#+STARTUP: overview hidestars -*- org -*-

* [0%] Core functionality
** [0%] Flashcard
** [0%] Add 'known words'
*** TODO Ditch TableArray and HookedArray altogether(?)
*** TODO Automatic coloration of stuff in “Known Words”.
*** TODO Crossing out of stuff in glossary list
    Crossed out stuff should automatically appear under “Known Words”, and
    anything under “Known Words” should automatically be crossed out when
    extracting a new glossary.
* [0%] Improvements
** [0%] Language parsing
*** TODO Make sure naked numerical elements work
    Like {vatlh}, all by itself.
*** TODO Should all handle graphotactically correct words
    Even if they do not appear in the dictionary. E.g. {Qov}.
*** TODO Handle {-oy} suffix
    When there is no glottal stop before it.
*** TODO Create FSM from dictionary
    Is this already done?
*** TODO Should prolly not use numbers words from dictionary
    Since those are defined in program itself.
*** TODO Result of {maH} looks bad
*** TODO Avoid duplicated words from dictionary
    E.g. {bachwI'} is both in dict and can be derived from rules.

** [0%] User interface
*** TODO Hover over word in input field should highlight all w/ same root
    If the word "bachwI'" is hovered on, then all words with that same root
    should be highlighted. ("bach", "bachqu'" etc.)
*** TODO Display some stats on analyzed text
    Text and glossary list should have a line where the number of words, verbs,
    nouns etc are listed.
*** TODO Words in legend under input field should be clickable
    (and enable/disable highlight of their respective categories)
*** TODO Choose part-of-speech for ambiguous words
    User should be able to select interpretations by clicking on words in
    input. Useful for those cases where the parser can't make up its mind.
*** TODO Add affixes to the glossary list                             :LATER:
    The affixes found should also be included in the glossary. Low priority.
** TODO In '# different' counter we should disregard complex words
   like "Hej(v)-wI'(vs9n)" that are in the dictionary, and instead only count
   the base "Hej(v)" word. Processing ("Hejlu' HejwI' Hej" gives, "3 words (2
   different)", but should actually be "3 words (1 different)".)
** TODO Select tab with keyboard
   Underline letter in tab name used to switch + complete keyboard shortcut
   name in mouseover text.
** TODO Placeholder text in text input field
   Should explains what to do (placeholder should be shown only if 'div' is
   empty, but even if selected.
* [33%] UI Bugs
** TODO Analyze button should cause immediate save
   Instead of waiting the usual 3 seconds.
** DONE Clear button should clear glossary as well
   CLOSED: [2012-11-14 Wed 03:53]
** TODO Word counters should update on reload
   Currently state is not saved for the word counters.
* [0%] Testing
** [0%] Test/check older browsers
*** TODO Check that tabs look okay in older browsers
** [0%] Test suite
*** For language parsing
**** paghlogh / Hochlogh / paghDIch / HochDIch
**** wa'Hu' .. wa'maHHu' (for number not in dictionary)
**** cha'leS .. HutleS (for number not in dictionary)
**** test on lots of canon text
