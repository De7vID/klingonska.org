* [0%] Core functionality
** [0%] Flashcard
** [62%] Add 'Known Words'
*** TODO Crossing out of words in known list
    Should uncross them on the glossary page. They should remain visible on the
    known page (in the crossed out state), but there should be a button to
    remove them.
*** TODO "Known words" table's word count should reflect current text
    I.e. word counts should be reset, and updated in the known list, too.
*** TODO Filter known glossary words
    There should be a selector, with which one can show/hide the words that are
    known. (If shown, they should be crossed out.)
*** DONE Glossary table should show some stats
    CLOSED: [2012-11-14 Wed 10:35]
    Specifically: Number of unknown words, known words, and total.
*** DONE Glossary & known words tables should have common class
    CLOSED: [2012-11-14 Wed 08:35]
    Which should in turn be used to control the common styling for these
    tables.
*** DONE Ditch TableArray and HookedArray altogether(?)
    CLOSED: [2012-11-14 Wed 07:35]
*** DONE Automatic coloration of stuff in “Known Words”.
    CLOSED: [2012-11-14 Wed 07:35]
*** DONE Crossing out of stuff in glossary list
    CLOSED: [2012-11-14 Wed 07:35]
    Crossed out stuff should automatically appear under “Known Words”, and
    anything under “Known Words” should automatically be crossed out when
    extracting a new glossary.
* [20%] Improvements
** TODO Each tab should have its own script file
   Which would then require that page.js declare everything relevant to this in
   a global scope.
** DONE Dictionary loading should not unwrap text
   CLOSED: [2012-11-14 Wed 08:43]
   WONTFIX. Turns out it doesn't matter. I mostly wanted it for prettier output
   in Upload/Download tab, but the linebreaks are displayed as literal "\n"
   anyway, so it's really no benefit over the current situation (= veeerry long
   lines).
** [0%] Language parsing
*** TODO Make sure naked numerical elements work
    Like {vatlh}, all by itself.
*** TODO Should all handle graphotactically correct words
    Even if they do not appear in the dictionary. E.g. {Qov}.
*** TODO Handle {-oy} suffix
    When there is no glottal stop before it.
*** TODO Create FSM from dictionary
    Is this already done?
*** TODO Should prolly not use numbers words from dictionary
    Since those are defined in program itself.
*** TODO Result of {maH} looks bad
*** TODO Avoid duplicated words from dictionary
    E.g. {bachwI'} is both in dict and can be derived from rules.
** [0%] User interface
*** TODO Known list can grow HUUUGE, should add filter capacity
    Add a thingy at top of list where one can write words, only table rows
    matching should be show. (Similar to Transmission's search feature.)
*** TODO Hover over word in input field should highlight all w/ same root
    If the word "bachwI'" is hovered on, then all words with that same root
    should be highlighted. ("bach", "bachqu'" etc.)
*** TODO Display some stats on analyzed text
    Text and glossary list should have a line where the number of words, verbs,
    nouns etc are listed.
*** TODO Words in legend under input field should be clickable
    (and enable/disable highlight of their respective categories)
*** TODO Choose part-of-speech for ambiguous words
    User should be able to select interpretations by clicking on words in
    input. Useful for those cases where the parser can't make up its mind.
*** TODO Add affixes to the glossary list                             :LATER:
    The affixes found should also be included in the glossary. Low priority.
** TODO In '# different' counter we should disregard complex words
   like "Hej(v)-wI'(vs9n)" that are in the dictionary, and instead only count
   the base "Hej(v)" word. Processing ("Hejlu' HejwI' Hej" gives, "3 words (2
   different)", but should actually be "3 words (1 different)".)
** TODO Select tab with keyboard
   Underline letter in tab name used to switch + complete keyboard shortcut
   name in mouseover text.
** TODO Placeholder text in text input field
   Should explains what to do (placeholder should be shown only if 'div' is
   empty, but even if selected.
* [33%] UI Bugs
** TODO Analyze button should cause immediate save
   Instead of waiting the usual 3 seconds.
** DONE Clear button should clear glossary as well
   CLOSED: [2012-11-14 Wed 03:53]
** TODO Word counters should update on reload
   Currently state is not saved for the word counters.
* [0%] Testing
** [0%] Test/check older browsers
*** TODO Check that tabs look okay in older browsers
** [0%] Test suite
*** For language parsing
**** paghlogh / Hochlogh / paghDIch / HochDIch
**** wa'Hu' .. wa'maHHu' (for number not in dictionary)
**** cha'leS .. HutleS (for number not in dictionary)
**** test on lots of canon text
