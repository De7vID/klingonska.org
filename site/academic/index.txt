Klingon in Academia
===================

Below is a list of various academic papers written on the Klingon language
and/or its community of Klingon speakers here on Earth.

This attempt to collect these articles in one place, is in no way complete, and
there are probably many more articles to be found out there. If you've spotted
paper in the wild that we've failed to include below, [please send us a
message](mailto:zrajm@klingonska.org?subject=Suggestion+for+Klingon+in+Academia).
