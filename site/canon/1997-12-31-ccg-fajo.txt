[[English translation from <The Fajo Collection> rulebook.]]

SUCCESS!

When threatened, fight. When in doubt, surprise them. Brute strength is not the
most important asset in a fight. Real power is in the heart. A Klingon does not
run away from his battles.

If an opponent attacks you, during that battle your Klingons with Honor add
INTEGRITY to STRENGTH. (Not cumulative.)
