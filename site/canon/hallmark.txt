Transcript
----------
<p>Gowron: {Qapla'}
<br><i>Greetings!</i></p>

<p class="noindent">Gowron: {pIj maSuvpu' batlh maSuvpu' 'ej maQapbejta'}
<br><i>In our many battles, we have fought with honor and achieved... victory!</i></p>

<p class="noindent">Gowron: {vaj malopmeH tlhIHvaD nob SaSuqpu'}
<br><i>So to celebrate, I’ve gotten you all a gift.</i></p>

<p class="noindent">Gowron: {tlhIngan toQDujHom 'oH}
<br><i>It’s a Klingon Bird-of-Prey ornament.</i></p>

<p class="noindent">Crewman 1: {toQDujna' rurchu'}
<br><i>It looks so real!</i></p>

<p class="noindent">Crewman 2: {Qapqu' wovmoHbogh janHommey}
<br><i>It even has working lights!</i></p>

<p class="noindent">Speaker: Hallmark introduces the exclusive Klingon keepsake
ornament. Call 1-800-HALLMARK for a Gold Crown store near you.</p>

<p class="noindent">Crewman 1: ({peghmo' ... }) [?!?]
<br><i>That was real nice of him.</i></p>

<p class="noindent">Crewman 2: {HIja'} &lt;gibberish&gt; {wISuqnIS} [??]
<br><i>Yeah, we should get him a thank you card.</i></p>

<hr>

The last two lines are badly garbled. Whatever gibberish Crewman 2 is saying,
from the verb prefix {wI-} it should be a singular object noun, probably formed
from the verb {tlho'} *thank* or the noun {tlho'} *appreciation, gratitude* --
*{tlho'meH nav/ghItlh} “thank you card”?

“The commercial switches to Federation Standard displaying the ship and giving
the sales pitch. After that we see the warriors speaking to one another as they
leave through the door. [This scene seems to follow the rule: ‘If you can’t
remember your lines, mumble a lot.’ We can only surmise that Dr. Okrand gave
them some legitimate lines and they chose to fake it instead.]” (Glen Proechel)

[Marc Okrand commented on the old MSN BBS (June 18,
1997)](1997-06-18b-news.txt): “I haven’t seen the commercial in a while, but I
don’t think {wov} was used as a noun there. Though the Klingons in the ad may
have ad libbed a bit, the phrase the one Klingon was supposed to say regarding
the little lights in the Bird of Prey ornament was {wovmoHbogh janHommey}. That
is, *little devices that cause (something) to be light or bright* or *little
devices that brighten (something)* or *little devices that light (something)
up* or the like. {wov} is a verb *be light, bright* followed by the suffix
{-moH} *cause* (thus, *cause to be light*).”
