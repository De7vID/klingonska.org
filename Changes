THEREAFTER
----------

* check that Stevo's suggestions (already done?) for corrections in CK and PK
  are implemented

* create a page for journalists (primary in Swedish, secondary in English) with
  a *very brief* howto on Klingon, what mistakes to avoid and what people to
  contact within the Klingon Scholarly Academy for more information
  o suggested reading: "The Quick 'n Dirty Guide to Klingon Grammar" by Teresh
    Donnelly [http://teresh.tdonnelly.org/briefklingram.html]

* create a bragging page with a list of interviews, lectures, courses and other
  things held by, or done in the name of, the Klingon Language Scholarly Academy
  o add the following (google up more info, if possible):

    * 2009-05-07 (about 8 o'clock in the morning): Appearance in Swedish
      national television program "Nyhetsmorgon" ("News morning") on channel
      TV4. Interviewed together with Peter Söderlund, chairman of Stockholm
      Trekkers. Their interest in Star Trek was spurred by the release of the
      new J.J. Abrams Star Trek movie.

      http://www.tv4.se/1.982905/2009/05/06/klingonska_for_dummies

    * 2006-10-05 (about 12 o'clock, mid-day): Appearance in Swedish national
      radio "P3 Lantz". Interviewed by Annika Lantz (famous radio personality in
      Sweden) on channel P3. The reason for their interest was the selling of
      Star Trek items by the auction company Christie's. The interview was later
      selected as one of the best of the season and re-run in parts.

      o http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/p3/programsidor/artikel.asp?ProgramID=2198&Artikel=958772

        (Search for "klingonska" in the page, or scroll waay down to "Torsdag 5
        oktober" -- page has brief articles for each day of that month, and they
        are ordered in reverse chronological order.)

    * 2003-01-21 Apperance on swedish national television in "Snick Snack om
      språk: Ett eget språk" ("Nonsense About Language: My Own Language"), was a
      subprogram of the "Krokodil" program block. "Snick Snack" is a children's
      program (age 6-9 years) intended to inspire an interest in language. The
      program is 10 minutes, and was the first part of a series of six "Snick
      Snack" programs. This program was produced by Sofia Johansson in 2002.

        "Snick Snack om språk: Ett eget språk" (part 1 of 6)

        Vilket var det första ord du sa? Antagligen mamma. Och när man väl har
        lärt sig att prata kan man ju börja hitta på hemliga språk. Björn kan
        prata Klingonska och drömmer om att hitta på ett alldeles eget språk.

* Web pages generated from templates & using Markdown
* XHTML compliant
* CSS-based design
* "Typographical" quotes

  -- one month old? Cookie, and based on visitor?)
* RSS feed for changes
* Call for participation from visitors
* Wiki-ish dictionary (which can be partially updated [and moderated?] by
  visitors)

* make sure all Klingon words on "http://teresh.tdonnelly.org/klinewest.html" is
  in the dictionary

* an inventory of klingon speakers? (Estimating the numbers of speakers, both
  fluent, and those with rudimentary knowledge [able to write a letter with help
  of a dictionary].)
  o fluent (an outsider would note an actual conversation, not too many
    repetions and {nuqjatlh}s), below is a list from a discussion on
    tlhIngan-Hol in August 2007:
    * list of all former beginner's grammarians?
    * charghwI' [Eric Andeen, 2007-08-02; Alan Andersson 2007-08-03]
    * DaQtIq (provisionally) -- I can't really be sure of DaQtIq's fluency, as I
      wasn't all that fluent myself when we spoke face to face. He was certainly
      quick and skilled at online chat, however. [Alan Andersson 2007-08-03]
    * DloraH, [Robyn Stewart, 2007-08-02; Alan Andersson 2007-08-03]
    * ghunchu'wI' [Robyn Stewart, 2007-08-02; Alan Andersson 2007-08-03]
    * Holtej [Robyn Stewart, 2007-08-02; Alan Andersson 2007-08-03]
    * nIchyon [Robyn Stewart, 2007-08-02; Alan Andersson 2007-08-03]
    * pagh [Robyn Stewart, 2007-08-02; Alan Andersson 2007-08-03]
    * qoror -- qoror was an impressively skilled young lad from Texas who used
      his mother's email account, a fact which thoroughly confused both me and
      her when I decided to contact him by telephone one day. [Alan Andersson
      2007-08-03]
    * Qanqor [Robyn Stewart, 2007-08-02; Alan Andersson 2007-08-03]
    * Qov [Robyn Stewart, 2007-08-02; Alan Andersson 2007-08-03]
    * Quvar (Lieven) [Eric Andeen, 2007-08-02; Alan Andersson 2007-08-03]
    * Seqram [Robyn Stewart, 2007-08-02; Alan Andersson 2007-08-03]
    * SuStel [Eric Andeen, 2007-08-02; Alan Andersson 2007-08-03]
    * taD [Robyn Stewart, 2007-08-02; Alan Andersson 2007-08-03]
    * taj'IH (a very slight stretch) -- taj'IH and I had brief moments of
      mutually understood conversation while wandering Brussels. Her command of
      the grammar was very good, and she both pronounced and understood the
      words wonderfully. Her vocabulary wasn't quite enough to keep it going for
      long without having to pause for dictionary lookups, though. [Alan
      Andersson 2007-08-03]
    * 'ISqu' [Robyn Stewart, 2007-08-02; Alan Andersson 2007-08-03]

2009-04-07
  * Fixed "canon/download.cgi" (now uses UTF-8)
    o SBX transcript added & UTF-ified
    o PK transcript added & UTF-ified
    o CK transcript added & UTF-ified
  * Fixed "dict/lexicon.cgi" script so that it includes header/footer and
    inputs/outputs using UTF-8

2009-04-04
  * Fetched current klingonska.org & installed that (= CGI's are not working)
  * Converted all text from latin-1 to utf-8
