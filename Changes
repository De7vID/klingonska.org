* Web pages generated from templates & using Markdown
* XHTML compliant
* CSS-based design
* "Typographical" quotes
* A "latest changes" indicator on page (& highlighting of recently changed stuff
  -- one month old? Cookie, and based on visitor?)

* Make proper use of em- and en-dashes where appropriate

* make sure all Klingon words on "http://teresh.tdonnelly.org/klinewest.html" is
  in the dictionary

* an inventory of klingon speakers? (Estimating the numbers of speakers, both
  fluent, and those with rudimentary knowledge [able to write a letter with help
  of a dictionary].)
  o fluent (an outsider would note an actual conversation, not too many
    repetions and {nuqjatlh}s), below is a list from a discussion on
    tlhIngan-Hol in August 2007:
    * charghwI' [Eric Andeen, 2007-08-02; Alan Andersson 2007-08-03]
    * DaQtIq (provisionally) -- I can't really be sure of DaQtIq's fluency, as I
      wasn't all that fluent myself when we spoke face to face. He was certainly
      quick and skilled at online chat, however. [Alan Andersson 2007-08-03]
    * DloraH, [Robyn Stewart, 2007-08-02; Alan Andersson 2007-08-03]
    * ghunchu'wI' [Robyn Stewart, 2007-08-02; Alan Andersson 2007-08-03]
    * Holtej [Robyn Stewart, 2007-08-02; Alan Andersson 2007-08-03]
    * nIchyon [Robyn Stewart, 2007-08-02; Alan Andersson 2007-08-03]
    * pagh [Robyn Stewart, 2007-08-02; Alan Andersson 2007-08-03]
    * qoror -- qoror was an impressively skilled young lad from Texas who used
      his mother's email account, a fact which thoroughly confused both me and
      her when I decided to contact him by telephone one day. [Alan Andersson
      2007-08-03]
    * Qanqor [Robyn Stewart, 2007-08-02; Alan Andersson 2007-08-03]
    * Qov [Robyn Stewart, 2007-08-02; Alan Andersson 2007-08-03]
    * Quvar (Lieven) [Eric Andeen, 2007-08-02; Alan Andersson 2007-08-03]
    * Seqram [Robyn Stewart, 2007-08-02; Alan Andersson 2007-08-03]
    * SuStel [Eric Andeen, 2007-08-02; Alan Andersson 2007-08-03]
    * taD [Robyn Stewart, 2007-08-02; Alan Andersson 2007-08-03]
    * taj'IH (a very slight stretch) -- taj'IH and I had brief moments of
      mutually understood conversation while wandering Brussels. Her command of
      the grammar was very good, and she both pronounced and understood the
      words wonderfully. Her vocabulary wasn't quite enough to keep it going for
      long without having to pause for dictionary lookups, though. [Alan
      Andersson 2007-08-03]
    * 'ISqu' [Robyn Stewart, 2007-08-02; Alan Andersson 2007-08-03]

    o SBX transcript added & UTF-ified
    o PK transcript added & UTF-ified
    o CK transcript added & UTF-ified
  * Fixed "dict/lexicon.cgi" script so that it includes header/footer and
    inputs/outputs using UTF-8

  * Converted all text from latin-1 to utf-8
