This is a page for Klingon music (and lyrics). I&rsquo;m collecting all
material that I can get a hold of, so you have the lyrics to a song (<I>any
song</I>) in this harsh language why not send it to me for inclusion here?

<br />     I would also like to make recordings of the songs available here,
so that you may hear the melody. It won&rsquo;t be high quality recordings (that
would eat to many kilobytes) and most likely they won&rsquo;t be all that fancy
either. Maybe just one unaccompanied voice to get the melody across.

<br />     If you have such a recording, or are willing to make one, then why
not send it to me for inclusion? I can be reached
at <i>&lt;<a href="mailto:zrajm@klingonska.org">zrajm@klingonska.org</a>&gt;</i>.
All contributions are very welcome.

  <dd>This is a translation of the »Gilligan&rsquo;s Island« theme song,
    sent to me by Knightsfyre. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s possible to
    sing it to the original melody, since I&rsquo;ve never heard the song (nor
    watched the show). If you can give me any information regarding writer, and
    year it was written I&rsquo;d greatly appreciate
    it. <small>[Changed 2007-07-15]</small>

    &ndash;&nbsp;<i>Row, Row, Row Your Boat</i></a></dt>
  <dd><i>Lyrics by Mark Shoulson(?), trad. melody.</i>
    <br />This is the original lyrics to the song most commonly known on Earth
    as "Row, Row, Row Your Boat". It is not just a translation of the
    meaningless Terran lyrics, but a complete restoration in which it becomes
    apparent what the song really is all
    about. <small>[Changed 2007-07-15]</small>

  <dt><a href="anthem/"><b>SuvwI&rsquo; van bom</b> &ndash;&nbsp;<i>The
    Warrior&rsquo;s Anthem</i> or <i>The Klingon Anthem</i></a></dt>
  <dd><i>Music by Paramount Pictures 1993, English & Klingon lyrics by Hillary
    Bader 1997, Klingon title by Marc Okrand(?) 1997.</i>
    <br />This song was first heard (in it&rsquo;s Paramount Hol version) in
    the TNG eposode "Birthright, Part II", and then again in the computer game
    "Star Trek: Klingon", later on Hillary Bader wrote lyrics in English
    and <b>tlhIngan Hol</b> (see also KGT p.175).

  <dt><a href="tahjaj_wo/"><b>taH&shy;jaj wo&rsquo;</b> &ndash;&nbsp;<i>An Imperial
    Anthem</i></a></dt>
  <dd><i>By Rich Yampell 1993.</i>
    <br />This is a hymn in honor of the Klingon Empire. It has been sung at
    all of the <b>qep&rsquo;a&rsquo;mey</b>. Hearing this song sung by a dozen
    or more klingonists, and in its full three part harmony, is really
    beautiful. There&rsquo;s even a parody of it, called <i>DaHjaj po</i> (see
    above). <small>[Changed 2010-11-05]</small>

  <dt><a href="toghmeh_bom.txt"><b>toghmeH bom</b> &ndash;&nbsp;<i>A Song for

    between zero and nine. <small>[Changed 2007-07-15]</small>

  <dt><a href="yih_bom.txt"><b>yIH bom</b> &ndash; <i>The Tribble
    Song</i></a></dt>
  <dd><i>Lyrics by Lawrence Shoen, music by Rich Yampell, written in 2000.</i>
    <br />This is a song intended for the bar room. It was first sung by
    Lawrence at the <b>qep&shy;&rsquo;a&rsquo; Soch&shy;DIch</b> and then we
    all got to sing along. (The <b>qep&shy;&rsquo;a&rsquo;</b> had a tribble
    theme, and the song was written specifically for the
    occasion.) <small>[Changed 2007-07-15]</small>

  <dd><i>Music and lyrics by Den Förlorade Generationen (&ldquo;The Lost
    Generation&rdquo;) in 1999(?), translated by Zrajm C Akfohg and Markus
    Persson in 2000.</i>
    <br />This song was originally written in Swedish, but at the request of
    the band who wrote it, we translated it into
    Klingon. <small>[Changed 2007-07-15]</small>

  <dt><a href="iv_mah.txt"><b>&rsquo;Iv maH</b> &ndash; <i>Who are
    we?</i></a></dt>
  <dd><i>By Rich Yampell in 1999.</i>
    <br />This is the KLI theme song. It was recorded at
    the <b>qep&shy;&rsquo;a&rsquo; Soch&shy;DIch</b> by a choir consisting of
    all attendants. (Including, among others: myself, Markus Persson, Captain
    Krankor, Mark Soulson, Lawrence Shoen, Will Martin, and some guy called
    Marc Okrand.) This recording will probably become a CD (this was the
    intention as far as I know). <small>[Changed 2007-07-15]</small>

<p>The summer of 2001 when I went to my second <b>qep&shy;&rsquo;a&rsquo;</b>
(this time in Brussels) I learned that there really are quite a lot more songs
around in Klingon than I previously thought. So, I made a list of songs that
got to know the name of so that I would know the name of my prey and be able to
hunt down the lyrics a bit easier. This is my list:</p>

<dl class="navigation">

  <dt>&ldquo;Good Morning Starshine&rdquo; (by Mark Shoulson)</dt>
  <dd>This is a translation of one of the songs from the musical &ldquo;Hair&rdquo;.</dd>

  <dt><b>Sub&shy;ma&rsquo;</b> (by Eric Andeen)</dt>

  <dt>&ldquo;The Noun Song&rdquo; (a Sesame Street song translated by Alan
    Anderson)</dt>

  <dt><b>taj</b> Song (a work-in-progress by Mark Shoulson)</dt>
  <dd>If I remember correctly, this has something to do with knives and
    forks.</dd>

  <dt>&lt;unknown title&gt; (a work-in-progress by Lawrence Shoen)</dt>
  <dd>This song is the story of a warrior which loses body part after body part
    in various battles. But he doesn&rsquo;t care, because he knowns that
    he&rsquo;ll be given them all back by Kahless the day he dies.</dd>

  <dt>A Klingon Lullaby (by d&rsquo;Armond Speers)</dt>
  <dd>This lullaby was read to us at the <b>qep&shy;&rsquo;a&rsquo;
    chorgh&shy;DIch</b> cabaret. According to d&rsquo;Armond the lyrics (there
    is no melody to it, at least not yet) is a part of a larger novel he is
    writing.</dd>
