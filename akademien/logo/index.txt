Klingonska Akademien's Logotype
===============================


History
-------

The logo was designed by me, _Zrajm C Akfohg,_ in March 1999. It was inspired by
the insignia of the Klingon Empire, as well as the logo for the Klingon Language
Institute. We wanted a logo that was uniquely distinct, while at the same time
showing a clear connection with Klingon.

I have used the logo as my desktop background for several years (still do!), and
one day in February 2008, when I saw it in the corner of my eye, the central
white circle appeared to me as the Moon. Inspired, I created the moon version of
our logo. (It has been pointed out to me that it should be the moon of the
Klingon Homeworld, there in the middle, and not the Earth's, but I have never
been able to find a picture of that moon -- _Praxis_ -- from before its
destruction in _Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country_.)


Cellphone Background Versions
-----------------------------

These are some images I use as a background on my Nokia cellphone. Pardon the
picture quality here, but these are actually photos of my _X Windows_ background
taken with my lo-rez cellphone camera. (None of which matter when you're just
going to display the pic on a 208 by 208 pixel display.)

First a version with most of the logo visible:

<img width="208" height="208" src="cellphone/ka-logo-208x208.jpg" alt="Klingonska Akademien's logo, 208x208 pixel, JPG format" />
<img width="208" height="208" src="cellphone/ka-logo-208x208.gif" alt="Klingonska Akademien's logo, 208x208 pixel, GIF format" />
<img width="1280" height="1024" src="cellphone/ka-logo.jpg" alt="Klingonska Akademien's logo, 1280x1024 pixel, JPG format" />


Now a more zoomed in version (which is the one I like the best):

<img width="208" height="208" src="cellphone/ka-logo-zoomed-208x208.jpg" alt="Klingonska Akademien's logo, 208x208 pixel, JPG format" />
<img width="208" height="208" src="cellphone/ka-logo-zoomed-208x208.gif" alt="Klingonska Akademien's logo, 208x208 pixel, GIF format" />
<img width="1280" height="1024" src="cellphone/ka-logo-zoomed.jpg" alt="Klingonska Akademien's logo, 1280x1024 pixel, JPG format" />
