<h1>Klingon Pocket Dictionary: Introduction</h1>

<p class="note">The first pages of text from the book.</p>
</div>

<div id="main">
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This dictionary consists of a collection of the Klingon words that could be
found in the various works of the inventor the language, Dr. Marc Okrand. Since
our intention has been to produce a practical pocket reference guide, rather
than a complete description of the language, it is assumed that you have at
least basic knowledge of the structure and grammar of Klingon. If you do not,
we urge you to read MO&rsquo;s main book on the subject, entitled
<em>The Klingon Dictionary</em> (Pocket Books, New York, 1992,
ISBN 0-671-74559-X).</p>

<p>The contents of this book was automatically created from a database
containing 2531 Klingon words and 3443 English lookup entries. The database was
created in late 1997 and has since been continuously updated. Should you find
any error or omission, or if you would like to know more about <em>Klingonska
Akademien</em> and our various projects, please do not hesitate to contact us
at the following address:</p>

<h2>Word Type Abbreviations</h2>

<p>This book uses the same scheme of word type abbreviations as TKD, with one
addition, the word type &ldquo;name,&rdquo; which is used for the names of
individuals. Only names mentioned in okrandian sources are included in the
dictionary.</p>

<h2>Source Abbreviations</h2>

<p>All Klingon words in this dictionary come from verifiable canon sources, but
those listed below are the most frequently occurring. However, some sources are
mentioned only rarely and are therefore not abbreviated. Most notably, when a
word originated from one of MO&rsquo;s many Usenet postings, the source is
given simply as &ldquo;News,&rdquo; with the date given in <em>YYYY-MM-DD</em>
format. If you want to identify or know more about a source given herein I
would recommend that you take a look at the &ldquo;Archive of Okrandian
Canon&rdquo; which can be found on the <em>Klingonska Akademien</em> website
(<em><a href="http://klingonska.org/">klingonska.org</a></em>) some additional
information can also be found in <em>The Klingon Mailing List FAQ</em>
(<em><a href="http://www.bigfoot.com/~dspeers/klingon/faq.htm"
>www.bigfoot.com/~dspeers/klingon/faq.htm</a></em>).</p>

<h2>Alphabet and Pronunciation</h2>

<p>The Klingon alphabetical order is as follows:</p>

<p class="center"><b lang="tlh">a</b>, <b lang="tlh">b</b>,
<b lang="tlh">ch</b>, <b lang="tlh">D</b>, <b lang="tlh">e</b>,
<b lang="tlh">gh</b>, <b lang="tlh">H</b>, <b lang="tlh">I</b>,
<b lang="tlh">j</b>, <b lang="tlh">l</b>, <b lang="tlh">m</b>,
<b lang="tlh">n</b>, <b lang="tlh">ng</b>, <b lang="tlh">o</b>,
<b lang="tlh">p</b>, <b lang="tlh">q</b>, <b lang="tlh">Q</b>,
<b lang="tlh">r</b>, <b lang="tlh">S</b>, <b lang="tlh">t</b>,
<b lang="tlh">tlh</b>, <b lang="tlh">u</b>, <b lang="tlh">v</b>,
<b lang="tlh">w</b>, <b lang="tlh">y</b>, <b lang="tlh">&rsquo;</b></p>

<p>Note that <b lang="tlh">ch</b>, <b lang="tlh">gh</b>, <b lang="tlh">ng</b>,
<b lang="tlh">tlh</b> and <b lang="tlh">&rsquo;</b> are considered letters in
their own right, and that, as a result of this, the word <b lang="tlh">nob</b>
would come <em>before</em> <b lang="tlh">ngab</b> in a Klingon alphabetic
listing. <b lang="tlh">q</b> and <b lang="tlh">Q</b> represent two different
sounds, and are thus sorted as two different letters.</p>

<p>This is only a rough guide to Klingon pronunciation, for a more detailed
description, see TKD section 1.</p>

<h2>Stress</h2>

<p>Verbs are always stressed on the last syllable of the word itself, and the
first suffix is never stressed. If, after that, there are any suffixes which
end in <b lang="tlh">&rsquo;</b> then they are stressed, too. There is an
exception to the above: If a speaker wishes to emphasize a particular suffix
(as is often the case with the interrogative suffix and suffixes for negation
and emphasis) then stress may shift to that suffix and leave the rest of the
word unstressed. Also note that adjectival verbs are stressed in the same way
as other verbs.</p>

<p>Nouns are usually stressed on the last syllable of the stem. But if there is
a syllable in the word, or any of its suffixes, which ends in
a <b lang="tlh">&rsquo;</b>, then that syllable is stressed instead. If there
is more than one such syllable, then they are all stressed. Also note that
nouns made from a verb plus <b lang="tlh">-wI&rsquo;</b>
or <b lang="tlh">-ghach</b> are stressed as nouns.</p>

<!-- <p>Klingon is a fictional language. It was created for the movie "Star
Trek III: The Search for Spock" by the linguist Marc Okrand, at a whim of
Paramount&rsquo;s (the Start Trek production company). It have subsequently
been used with Marc Okrand&rsquo;s coaching in Star Trek films V ("The Final
Frontier") and VI ("The Undiscovered Country"), and few books (TKD, TKW and
KGT) and audio tapes (CK, PK).</p>

<p>Some uses of "Klingon" (not coached by MO) have also been made by Paramount
in the different TV-series (TNG, DS9 and VGR) and "Star Trek VII: Generations"
(sometimes this use is called "Paramount <b lang="tlh>Hol</b>" among Klingonists
&ndash; <b lang="tlh">Hol</b> means "language" in Klingon). Most often their
use is gibberish, though sometimes one or two Klingon words can be heard, but
almost always following basic English rules of grammar.</p>

<p>Ever since I started learning Klingon I have felt the need for a new Klingon
dictionary. One small enough to easily fit into a pocket, (the TKD is simply to
big to carry around for everyday use) while large enough to collect all Klingon
words in one single book (no more having to look a word in three or four lists
to find it). To fill this need I created a dictionary of my own. My first
attempts where humle, using word lists from
the <b lang="tlh">mu&rsquo;HaqwI&rsquo;</b> and <b lang="tlh">tlhIngan Hol
pojwI&rsquo;</b> Klingon translation and analysing programs, the very first
contained only an English&ndash;Klingon listing. Later on I produced
the <b lang="tlh">Hol pab je mu&rsquo;ghomHom</b> which (despite its name) did
not contain any grammar at all. This was done not long before the release
of <em>Klingon for the Galactic Traveler</em> here in Sweden, so the new words
were never included. Originally not even a pronounciation guide was included,
but after frequent requests I added a sheet explaining the phonetics. &ndash; I
have distributed somewhere in between forty and fifty copies of this book on
local Trek-cons and through/to friends.</p>

<p>Today I am planning a new edition with the ambition to expand the dictionary
to include <em>all</em> canon words and also some basic and frequently used
grammar. (Mostly lookup-tables, such as a pronominal prefix chart, verb and
noun suffix tables and tables of adverbials and numbers.) I would also like to
include guides to different concepts, as how to talk about time, or how express
locations, placement and colours. Themes might (or might not, depending on
space) be included to easily find words related to a special situation or
object (such as names of different body parts, words related to food/drinks and
cooking/eating, weapons/tools and fighting/warfare, prepositional concepts,
family and names, animals and plants, emotions, clothes, music etc.) This new
edition will also feature an easy-to-find flip-index for fast look-up.</p>

<p>The (natural) focus on the entire work is okrandian canon &ndash; with one
exception &ndash; <b lang="tlh">pIqaD</b>. This alphabet is endorsed by the
Klingon Language Institute, but has never officially become canon (i.e. never
made it to the screen), Paramount uses a set of ten glyphs once constructed by
the Image Astra Corporation, more or less randomly spread, for effect. The
dictionary will contain a brief description of this alphabet and its glyphs,
complete with numbers and punctuation marks (as seen on the SkyBox Trading
Cards) as well as how to write them in longhand.</p>

<p>As these sections are written I will make them accessible through this page.
Any comments and/or ideas are welcome. Contributions are also welcome, and all
