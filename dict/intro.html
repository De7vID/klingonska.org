<h1>Klingon Pocket Dictionary: Introduction</h1>

<p class="note">The first pages of text from the book.</p>
</div>

<div id="main">
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This dictionary consists of a collection of the Klingon words that could be
found in the various works of the inventor the language, Dr. Marc Okrand. Since
our intention has been to produce a practical pocket reference guide, rather
than a complete description of the language, it is assumed that you have at
least basic knowledge of the structure and grammar of Klingon. If you do not,
we urge you to read MO&rsquo;s main book on the subject, entitled
<em>The Klingon Dictionary</em> (Pocket Books, New York, 1992,
ISBN 0-671-74559-X).</p>

<p>The contents of this book was automatically created from a database
containing 2531 Klingon words and 3443 English lookup entries. The database was
created in late 1997 and has since been continuously updated. Should you find
any error or omission, or if you would like to know more about <em>Klingonska
Akademien</em> and our various projects, please do not hesitate to contact us
at the following address:</p>

<h2>Word Type Abbreviations</h2>

<p>This book uses the same scheme of word type abbreviations as TKD, with one
addition, the word type &ldquo;name,&rdquo; which is used for the names of
individuals. Only names mentioned in okrandian sources are included in the
dictionary.</p>

<h2>Source Abbreviations</h2>

<p>All Klingon words in this dictionary come from verifiable canon sources, but
those listed below are the most frequently occurring. However, some sources are
mentioned only rarely and are therefore not abbreviated. Most notably, when a
word originated from one of MO&rsquo;s many Usenet postings, the source is
given simply as &ldquo;News,&rdquo; with the date given
in <em>YYYY-MM-DD</em> format. If you want to identify or know more
about a source given herein I would recommend that you take a look at the
&ldquo;Archive of Okrandian Canon&rdquo; which can be found on
the <em>Klingonska Akademien</em> website
(<em><a href="http://klingonska.org/">klingonska.org</a></em>) some additional
information can also be found in <em>The Klingon Mailing List FAQ</em>
(<em><a href="http://www.bigfoot.com/~dspeers/klingon/faq.htm"
>www.bigfoot.com/~dspeers/klingon/faq.htm</a></em>).</p>

<h2>Alphabet and Pronunciation</h2>

<p>The Klingon alphabetical order is as follows:</p>

<p class="center"><strong lang="tlh">a</strong>, <strong lang="tlh">b</strong>,
<strong lang="tlh">ch</strong>, <strong lang="tlh">D</strong>,
<strong lang="tlh">e</strong>, <strong lang="tlh">gh</strong>,
<strong lang="tlh">H</strong>, <strong lang="tlh">I</strong>,
<strong lang="tlh">j</strong>, <strong lang="tlh">l</strong>,
<strong lang="tlh">m</strong>, <strong lang="tlh">n</strong>,
<strong lang="tlh">ng</strong>, <strong lang="tlh">o</strong>,
<strong lang="tlh">p</strong>, <strong lang="tlh">q</strong>,
<strong lang="tlh">Q</strong>, <strong lang="tlh">r</strong>,
<strong lang="tlh">S</strong>, <strong lang="tlh">t</strong>,
<strong lang="tlh">tlh</strong>, <strong lang="tlh">u</strong>,
<strong lang="tlh">v</strong>, <strong lang="tlh">w</strong>,
<strong lang="tlh">y</strong>, <strong lang="tlh">&rsquo;</strong></p>

<p>Note that <strong lang="tlh">ch</strong>, <strong lang="tlh">gh</strong>,
<strong lang="tlh">ng</strong>, <strong lang="tlh">tlh</strong> and
<strong lang="tlh">&rsquo;</strong> are considered letters in their own
right, and that, as a result of this, the word <strong lang="tlh">nob</strong>
would come <em>before</em> <strong lang="tlh">ngab</strong> in a Klingon
alphabetic listing. <strong lang="tlh">q</strong>
and <strong lang="tlh">Q</strong> represent two different sounds, and are thus
sorted as two different letters.</p>

<p>This is only a rough guide to Klingon pronunciation, for a more
detailed description, see TKD section 1.</p>

<h2>Stress</h2>

<p>Verbs are always stressed on the last syllable of the word itself, and the
first suffix is never stressed. If, after that, there are any suffixes which
end in <strong lang="tlh">&rsquo;</strong> then they are stressed, too. There
is an exception to the above: If a speaker wishes to emphasize a particular
suffix (as is often the case with the interrogative suffix and suffixes for
negation and emphasis) then stress may shift to that suffix and leave the rest
of the word unstressed. Also note that adjectival verbs are stressed in the
same way as other verbs.</p>

<p>Nouns are usually stressed on the last syllable of the stem. But if there is
a syllable in the word, or any of its suffixes, which ends in
a <strong lang="tlh">&rsquo;</strong>, then that syllable is stressed instead.
If there is more than one such syllable, then they are all stressed. Also note
that nouns made from a verb plus <strong lang="tlh">-wI&rsquo;</strong>
or <strong lang="tlh">-ghach</strong> are stressed as nouns.</p>

<!-- <p>Klingon is a fictional language. It was created for the
movie "Star Trek III: The Search for Spock" by the linguist Marc Okrand, at a
whim of Paramount&rsquo;s (the Start Trek production company). It have
subsequently been used with Marc Okrand&rsquo;s coaching in Star Trek films V
("The Final Frontier") and VI ("The Undiscovered Country"), and few books (TKD,
TKW and KGT) and audio tapes (CK, PK).</p>

<p>Some uses of "Klingon" (not coached by MO) have also been made by
Paramount in the different TV-series (TNG, DS9 and VGR) and "Star Trek VII:
Generations" (sometimes this use is called "Paramount Hol" among Klingonists
&ndash; <strong lang="tlh">Hol</strong> means "language" in Klingon). Most
often their use is gibberish, though sometimes one or two Klingon words can be
heard, but almost always following basic English rules of grammar.</p>

<p>Ever since I started learning Klingon I have felt the need for a new Klingon
dictionary. One small enough to easily fit into a pocket, (the TKD is simply to
big to carry around for everyday use) while large enough to collect all Klingon
words in one single book (no more having to look a word in three or four lists
to find it). To fill this need I created a dictionary of my own. My first
attempts where humle, using word lists from
the <strong lang="tlh">mu&rsquo;HaqwI&rsquo;</strong>
and <strong lang="tlh">tlhIngan Hol pojwI&rsquo;</strong> Klingon translation
and analysing programs, the very first contained only an English&ndash;Klingon
listing. Later on I produced the <strong lang="tlh">Hol pab je
mu&rsquo;ghomHom</strong> which (despite its name) did not contain any grammar
at all. This was done not long before the release of <em>Klingon for the
Galactic Traveler</em> here in Sweden, so the new words were never included.
Originally not even a pronounciation guide was included, but after frequent
requests I added a sheet explaining the phonetics. &ndash; I have distributed
somewhere in between forty and fifty copies of this book on local Trek-cons and
through/to friends.</p>

<p>Today I am planning a new edition with the ambition to expand the
dictionary to include <em>all</em> canon words and also some basic and
frequently used grammar. (Mostly lookup-tables, such as a pronominal prefix
chart, verb and noun suffix tables and tables of adverbials and numbers.) I
would also like to include guides to different concepts, as how to talk about
time, or how express locations, placement and colours. Themes might (or might
not, depending on space) be included to easily find words related to a special
situation or object (such as names of different body parts, words related to
food/drinks and cooking/eating, weapons/tools and fighting/warfare,
prepositional concepts, family and names, animals and plants, emotions,
clothes, music etc.) This new edition will also feature an easy-to-find
flip-index for fast look-up.</p>

<p>The (natural) focus on the entire work is okrandian canon &ndash; with one
exception &ndash; <strong lang="tlh">pIqaD</strong>. This alphabet is endorsed
by the Klingon Language Institute, but has never officially become canon (i.e.
never made it to the screen), Paramount uses a set of ten glyphs once
constructed by the Image Astra Corporation, more or less randomly spread, for
effect. The dictionary will contain a brief description of this alphabet and
its glyphs, complete with numbers and punctuation marks (as seen on the SkyBox
Trading Cards) as well as how to write them in longhand.</p>

<p>As these sections are written I will make them accessible through this page.
Any comments and/or ideas are welcome. Contributions are also welcome, and all
contributed material will be duely credited.</p> -->
