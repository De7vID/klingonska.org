<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p align=justify>This dictionary consists of a collection of the
Klingon words that could be found in the various works of the inventor
the language, Dr. Marc Okrand. Since our intention has been to
produce a practical pocket reference guide, rather than a complete
description of the language, it is assumed that you have at least
basic knowledge of the structure and grammar of Klingon. If you do
not, we urge you to read MO's main book on the subject, entitled
<i>The Klingon Dictionary</i> (Pocket Books, New York, 1992,
ISBN 0-671-74559-X).

<br>     The contents of this book was automatically created from a
database containing 2531 Klingon words and 3443 English lookup
entries. The database was created in late 1997 and has since been
continuously updated. Should you find any error or omission, or if you
would like to know more about <i>Klingonska Akademien</i> and our
various projects, please do not hesitate to contact us at the

<h2>Word Type Abbreviations</h2>

<p align=justify>This book uses the same scheme of word type
abbreviations as TKD, with one addition, the word type ``name,'' which
is used for the names of individuals. Only names mentioned in
okrandian sources are included in the dictionary.

<h2>Source Abbreviations</h2>

<p align=justify>All Klingon words in this dictionary come from
verifiable canon sources, but those listed below are the most
frequently occurring.  However, some sources are mentioned only rarely
and are therefore not abbreviated. Most notably, when a word
originated from one of MO's many Usenet postings, the source is given
simply as ``News,'' with the date given in <i>YYYY-MM-DD</i>
format. If you want to identify or know more about a source given
herein I would recommend that you take a look at the ``Archive of
Okrandian Canon'' which can be found on the <i>Klingonska
Akademien</i> website (<i>www.klingonska.org</i>) some additional
information can also be found in <i>The Klingon Mailing List FAQ</i>
(<i><a href="http://www.bigfoot.com/~dspeers/klingon/faq.htm"
>www.bigfoot.com/~dspeers/klingon/faq.htm</a></i>).

<h2>Alphabet and Pronunciation</h2>

<p align=justify>The Klingon alphabetical order is as follows:

<p><center>
<b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>ch</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>gh</b>,
<b>H</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>j</b>, <b>l</b>, <b>m</b>, <b>n</b>, <b>ng</b>,
<b>o</b>, <b>p</b>, <b>q</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>r</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>t</b>,
<b>tlh</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>v</b>, <b>w</b>, <b>y</b>, <b>'</b>
</center>

<p align=justify>Note that <b>ch</b>, <b>gh</b>, <b>ng</b>, <b>tlh</b>
and <b>'</b> are considered letters in their own right, and that, as a
result of this, the word <b>nob</b> would come <i>before</i>
<b>ngab</b> in a Klingon alphabetic listing. <b>q</b> and <b>Q</b>
represent two different sounds, and are thus sorted as two different
letters.

<br>     This is only a rough guide to Klingon pronunciation, for a more
detailed description, see TKD section 1.

<h2>Stress</h2>

<p align=justify>Verbs are always stressed on the last syllable of the
word itself, and the first suffix is never stressed. If, after that,
there are any suffixes which end in <b>'</b> then they are stressed,
too. There is an exception to the above: If a speaker wishes to
emphasize a particular suffix (as is often the case with the
interrogative suffix and suffixes for negation and emphasis) then
stress may shift to that suffix and leave the rest of the word
unstressed. Also note that adjectival verbs are stressed in the same
way as other verbs.

<br>     Nouns are usually stressed on the last syllable of the
stem. But if there is a syllable in the word, or any of its suffixes,
which ends in a <b>'</b>, then that syllable is stressed instead. If
there is more than one such syllable, then they are all stressed. Also
note that nouns made from a verb plus <b>-wI'</b> or <b>-ghach</b> are
stressed as nouns.




<!-- <P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Klingon is a fictional language. It was created for
the movie "Star Trek III: The Search for Spock" by the linguist Marc
Okrand, at a whim of Paramount's (the Start Trek production
company). It have subsequently been used with Marc Okrand's coaching
in Star Trek films V ("The Final Frontier") and VI ("The Undiscovered
Country"), and few books (TKD, TKW and KGT) and audio tapes (CK, PK).



<BR>     Some uses of "Klingon" (not coached by MO) have
also been made by Paramount in the different TV-series (TNG, DS9 and VGR)
and "Star Trek VII: Generations" (sometimes this use is called "Paramount
Hol" among Klingonists - <B>Hol</B> means "language" in Klingon). Most
often their use is gibberish, though sometimes one or two Klingon words can
be heard, but almost always following basic English rules of grammar.



<BR>     Ever since I started learning Klingon I have
felt the need for a new Klingon dictionary. One small enough to easily fit
into a pocket, (the TKD is simply to big to carry around for everyday use)
while large enough to collect all Klingon words in one single book (no more
having to look a word in three or four lists to find it). To fill this need
I created a dictionary of my own. My first attempts where humle, using word
lists from the <B>mu'HaqwI'</B> and <B>tlhIngan Hol pojwI'</B> Klingon
translation and analysing programs, the very first contained only an
English-Klingon listing. Later on I produced the <B>Hol pab je
mu'ghomHom</B> which (despite its name) did not contain any grammar at all.
This was done not long before the release of <I>Klingon for the Galactic
Traveler</I> here in Sweden, so the new words were never included.
Originally not even a pronounciation guide was included, but after frequent
requests I added a sheet explaining the phonetics. - I have distributed
somewhere in between forty and fifty copies of this book on local Trek-cons
and through/to friends.


<BR>     Today I am planning a new edition with the
ambition to expand the dictionary to include <I>all</I> canon words and
also some basic and frequently used grammar. (Mostly lookup-tables, such as
a pronominal prefix chart, verb and noun suffix tables and tables of
adverbials and numbers.) I would also like to include guides to different
concepts, as how to talk about time, or how express locations, placement
and colours. Themes might (or might not, depending on space) be included to
easily find words related to a special situation or object (such as names
of different body parts, words related to food/drinks and cooking/eating,
weapons/tools and fighting/warfare, prepositional concepts, family and
names, animals and plants, emotions, clothes, music etc.) This new edition
will also feature an easy-to-find flip-index for fast look-up.

<BR>     The (natural) focus on the entire work is
okrandian canon - with one exception - <B>pIqaD</B>. This alphabet is
endorsed by the Klingon Language Institute, but has never officially become
canon (i.e. never made it to the screen), Paramount uses a set of ten
glyphs once constructed by the Image Astra Corporation, more or less
randomly spread, for effect. The dictionary will contain a brief
description of this alphabet and its glyphs, complete with numbers and
punctuation marks (as seen on the SkyBox Trading Cards) as well as how to
write them in longhand.

<BR>     As these sections are written I will make them
accessible through this page. Any comments and/or ideas are welcome.
Contributions are also welcome, and all contributed material will be duely
credited.-->
