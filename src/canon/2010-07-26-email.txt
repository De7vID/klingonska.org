Marc was listening in while Eric was telling me the words. When we got to
ghIv, gham was brought up. Marc described ghIv as the "person" version of
gham.
Marc also clarified that Qutlh (support) can only refer to physically
supporting something. It can't refer to monetary (he said ghaq is for this),
psychological or any other non-physical type of support. This seemed to
interest Krankor, but it may be common knowledge. :D
