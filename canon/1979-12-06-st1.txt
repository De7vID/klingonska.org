Star Trek: The Motion Picture

Marc Okrand has always given full credit to James Doohan and Mark Lenard (who
plays the Klingon captain) for creating the eleven original words that he used
as the basis for {tlhIngan Hol}. (Not a great deal to base a whole language
upon really.) This is Okrand's version of the opening scene (done after the
fact) with the subtitles as they appeared in the movie:

Klingon captain: {wIy cha'}
"Tactical..."

Klingon captain: {HaSta}
"Visual..."

Klingon captain: {cha yIghuS}
"Tactical, stand by on torpedoes."

Klingon captain: {'eH}
"Ready..."

[Klingon captain raises his hand in preparation for the order to fire.]

Klingon captain: {SSS... baH}
"Fire!"

Klingon captain: {junchoH}
"Evasive!"

However, according to an interview with actor Mark Lenard in <{HolQeD} 4:3>:
"They never had a real meaning, they had various translations of it..." His
lines were (prounouncing "ch" as in Yiddish/German):

	HUIT TCHA
	("Did you see what I saw?")

	ECHSS TU

	HUIT TCHA EK'KOOS or HUIT TCHA ECH'CHOOS

	HUISS HA ZOONTAHK

	PSHAAH BISMACHT

	KAIYI KLINGON KUZIMA PSHAAH

	KUZUG OCHS MUJI AZAK

	ICH ACH KOS ZZTUT TUDJIOCHS
	HARAS MUJIA UDJIK KAMAZAK
	SPUZ KAZUK GARAND - KAIYI
	KLINGON KUZIMA AK ZO AK
