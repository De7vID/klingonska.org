The commercial has a Klingon commander (played by Robert O'Reilly) rewarding his
officers for their victory in battle by giving them a gift - a Klingon
Bird-of-Prey Christmas ornament. We then see an insert shot of the ornament in
Guy Vardaman's hand, after which Vardaman's Klingon remarks "That was very nice
of him", to which the other Klingon suggests giving their commander a "thank
you" card.


Gowron: pIj maSuvpu' batlh maSuvpu' 'ej maQapbejta'
In our many battles, we have fought with honor and achieved victory!

Gowron: vaj malopmeH tlhIHvaD nob SaSuqpu'.
So to celebrate, I've gotten you all a gift.

Qapqu' wovmoHbogh janHommey! 
It even has working lights!

                       HALLMARK BIRD-OF-PREY ORNAMENT COMMERCIAL
                                 (Winter [Christmas] 1994?)

GOWRON:    {Qapla'}
          Greetings!

          {pIj maSuvpu' batlh maSuvpu' 'ej maQapbejta'}
          In our many battles, we have fought with honor and
          achieved... VICTORY!

          {vaj malopmeH tlhIHvaD nob SaSuqpu'}
          So to celebrate, I've gotten you all a gift.

          {tlhIngan toQDujHom 'oH}
          It's a Klingon Bird-of-Prey ornament.

CREWMAN 1: {toQDujna' rurchu'}
          It looks so real!

CREWMAN 2: {Qapqu' wovmoHbogh janHommey}
          It even has working lights!

CREWMAN 1: ({peghmo' ... })                               (?!?)
          That was real nice of him.

CREWMAN 2: {HIja' <gibberish> wISuqnIS}                    (??)
          Yeah, we should get him a thank you card.

The last two lines are badly garbled. Whatever gibberish Crewman 2 is saying,
from the verb prefix {wI-} it should be a singular object noun, probably formed
from the verb {tlho'} "thank" or the noun {tlho'} "appreciation, gratitude" --
*{tlho'meH nav/ghItlh} "thank you card"?

"The commercial switches to Federation Standard displaying the ship and giving
the sales pitch. After that we see the warriors speaking to one another as they
leave through the door. [This scene seems to follow the rule: 'If you can't
remember your lines, mumble a lot.' We can only surmise that Dr. Okrand gave
them some legitimate lines and they chose to fake it instead." (Glen Proechel)]

Marc Okrand commented on the old MSN BBS (6/18/1997):
"I haven't seen the commercial in a while, but I don't think wov was used as a
noun there. Though the Klingons in the ad may have ad libbed a bit, the phrase
the one Klingon was supposed to say regarding the little lights in the Bird of
Prey ornament was {wovmoHbogh janHommey}. That is, 'little devices that cause
(something) to be light or bright' or 'little devices that brighten (something)'
or 'little devices that light (something) up' or the like. {wov} is a verb 'be
light, bright' followed by the suffix {-moH} 'cause' (thus, 'cause to be
light')."
