Learning about Klingon character or mindset by way of studying what Qermaq
terms "defaults" in vocabulary will probably lead to interesting insights. 
I think both Qermaq and SuStel are on the right track: {par} "dislike," for
example, is probably the more neutral or expected reaction of a Klingon to
someone else; {parHa'} "like" (or, more revealingly, "not dislike" or
"undislike" or "misdislike"  or even "disdislike" [?!], since it's made up
of {par} "dislike" plus {-Ha'}, the negative suffix implying that something
is undone or done wrongly) is a modification (an undoing?) of this expected
reaction. 

It may be that not everything has a default.  Note, for example, {QuchHa'}
"be unhappy" and {'IQ} "be sad."  These two words don't mean quite the same
thing: {QuchHa'} is made up of {Quch} "be happy" plus the negative suffix
{-Ha'}, suggesting a change from being happy to not being happy. {'IQ} does
not have this connotation, nor does {Quchbe'} "be not happy" (or, if you
prefer, "not be happy").  Nevertheless, is the default in this pair {Quch}
"be happy" or is it {'IQ} "be sad"? 

On the other hand, when the only way to express a certain idea is by
modifying a word (for example, by adding a suffix) rather than using an
entirely different word, perhaps one can argue that the nonmodified word is
the default.  Thus, the only (known) way to express the opposite of {par}
"dislike" is by adding a negative suffix to {par}.  Unlike {QuchHa'} "be
unhappy" and {'IQ} "be sad," there's no choice when it comes to "like";
you've got to use a word based on {par}: {parHa'}.  It appears that the
only kind of "like" there is is the "undoing" or "misapplication" of
"dislike."  (Of course, you could also say {parbe'} "like" or, more
literally, "not dislike,"  using the negative suffix {-be'} "not"; but
{parbe'} is also based on {par}.  {parHa'} is heard more frequently than
{parbe'}, however, and this may be a hint at the usual way a Klingon looks
at things.) 

Interestingly (and bolstering the idea that "dislike" is a default),
there's also the word {muS} "hate" (which is presumably stronger somehow
than {par} "dislike").  It also has no known opposite except for the
suffixed forms:  {muSHa'} "dis-hate" or "unhate"; {muSbe'} "not hate."

The short answer is that we *can* have QochHa', it's just not listed in the
Dictionary.  As I wrote elsewhere (in the old MSN newsgroup, but repeated
in another thread in this newsgroup), for the most part, words in The
Klingon Dictionary consisting of verb + suffix are there as a matter of
convenience.  That is, if you want to look up how to say "misinterpret,"
it's there -- {yajHa'}.  {yajHa'} consists of {yaj} "understand" plus the
negative suffix {-Ha'} "undo," and, even though {yajHa'} is an entry in the
Dictionary, there is nothing to prevent other suffixes, including the other
negative suffix {-be'}, from following {yaj}.  Thus {yajbe'} is a perfectly
well-formed word meaning "not understand." 

Because there is a meaning difference between the two negative suffixes
(for sake of brevity, {-Ha'} suggests doing or being something in the wrong
way or undoing something; {-be'} suggests simply not doing or not being
something), there is a meaning difference between {yajbe'} and {yajHa'}. 
The first word implies the absence of understanding ("not understand"); the
second implies that any understanding that there may have been was
imprecise or askew or not properly done ("misunderstand, misinterpret"). 

Which brings us to {Qochbe'} and {QochHa'}.  Both consist of the verb
{Qoch} "disagree" plus a negative suffix.  Parallel to the example above
with {yaj} "understand,"  {Qochbe'} implies an absence of disagreeing
(hence "agree"); {QochHa'} implies that any disagreeing was misplaced or
misconstrued or perhaps has been "undone."  English lacks a simple way to
say this.  (At least I couldn't think of one; if anyone has any
suggestions, I'd be interested in seeing them.)  Made-up words like
"misdisagree" or "undisagree" may get the idea across, but they're hardly
elegant (unlike Klingon {QochHa'}, which is elegance itself). 

Now this raises another question, slightly different from the original one:
If both {Qochbe'} and {QochHa'} are acceptable Klingon words, why is one in
the Dictionary and the other not?  For better or worse, the Dictionary is a
"one size fits all" sort of work.  It's for those who want to study the
language in depth (though it is far from exhaustive), but also for those
who want a quick reference (How do you say "agree"?).  Since "agree" (that
is, "not disagree") is probably going to be said more frequently that
"misdisagree" (or a more felicitous equivalent), it got to be listed. 
Similarly, {naDHa'} "discommend" is listed due to its importance in Klingon
culture, though {naDbe'} "not commend" is a properly formed word.

Well, SuStel got to this before I did.  Not surprisingly (given his
expertise in the language), much of what he said is what I would have said
anyway.

This is true.  The original script for "Star Trek VI"  (well, the earliest
version that I saw, anyway) had the English translations for the lines
spoken by the Klingon at the Morska listening post in a peculiar kind of
English to show that it was a different way of speaking.  As the filming
proceeded, the character changed somewhat so that he became an inattentive
Klingon rather than merely a Klingon from some different region, but we
kept the nonstandard dialect anyway.  (So he became an inattentive Klingon
from a part of the Empire we've not heard much about.)

All well said.  Let me elaborate just a bit.  The system used to transcribe
Klingon, making use of letters from the English (well, Roman) alphabet, was
devised so that the reader would have some notion of how to pronounce the
words.  Since the system was originally developed as a guide for
English-speaking actors (and then retained for English-speaking readers of
the Dictionary), most of the letters represent the same sound that they
represent in English.  Thus {b} is the same as "b" in "boy," {t} is like
"t" in "toy," and so on. 

But, as SuStel points out, there are some sounds in Klingon that do not
occur in English (or have no standard ways to be represented by English
letters), so a way was needed to write each of them.  This was handled by
various means: 

(1) In one case, the letter {q} was used to represent a sound sort of like
English "k," but made farther back in the mouth.  In English words, "q" is
always followed by "u"  (and then by another vowel) and the combination of
the two, "qu," is pronounced like "kw."  (Words taken into English from
other languages don't necessarily follow this pattern;  e.g., "quiche.") 
Since "q" without its companion "u" isn't used in English (except in a few
words of foreign origin), it was available to represent a non-English sound
in Klingon.  And since "q" in English represents the "k" part of the "kw"
sound, it was a good candidate to represent a "k"-like sound in Klingon. 
{q} rather than {k} was chosen for this Klingon sound so that the reader
would be aware that it's a sound different from "k." 

(2) In two cases, a combination of letters which does not occur as such in
English was used: {tlh} and {gh}. 

(3) In one case, a symbol used in English writing, though, properly
speaking, not a letter itself, was used for a sound: {'}, the apostrophe. 
This is a "glottal stop" -- a quick pause in vocalization which occurs, for
example, in between the two syllables in English "uh-uh" (meaning "no"). 

And finally, since this is what the original question was about: 

(4) In all other cases of non-English sounds, capital letters were used. 
SuStel mentions {D}, {H}, and {Q};  another is {S}. 

There is one other capital letter used in Klingon: {I}.  This represents
the very English sound written with "i" in "sit."  In Klingon, {I} was
chosen for this sound (rather than {i}) to help ensure that it would not be
pronounced like the "i" in "mine" or in "machine." 

(The other vowels in Klingon, {a}, {e}, {o}, and {u}, can be read with the
values they have in Romance languages like Spanish.  But Romance/Spanish
"i" is not the same as Klingon {I}, which is why the Klingon vowel gets
singled out for capitalization.  [Actually, Klingon {e} and Spanish "e"
aren't the same either, but they're close enough for this discussion.]) 

It's important to remember that this system of transcribing Klingon with
the weird letter combinations (like {tlh}) and capital letters is just
that: a transcription.  It's a way to represent in writing the sounds of
the spoken language.  And it's done so that a reader will have a reasonable
shot at getting it right.  It's not the official Klingon way of writing! 
The way Klingons write their own language is with a set of characters
(called {pIqaD}) that you've seen on control panels and viewscreens and
doorways in various episodes and films.  The Roman-letter transcription is
a crutch for those of us who can't read {pIqaD}. 

I got a little long-winded here.  But hope this helps.
