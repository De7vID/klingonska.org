Klingon text from the SkyBox Trading Cards, translated by Marc Okrand.

   Created: 1998-06-14 -- 1998-06-15, by Zrajm C Akfohg
   Updated: 1998-10-05, machine-parsed for incorrect syllables (errors: 2)
   Updated: 1999-07-14, added S31--S33 from HQ 6:2
   Updated: 2004-01-09, added missing last aphostophe on one occurance of
     {qItI'nga} in the S15 SkyBox Card (thanx to Steven Lytle
     <MorphemeAddict@wmconnect.com> for pointing it out!)

This is an attempt at collecting all text in Klingon attributed to Marc
Okrand on the SkyBox Trading Cards. It is probably far from finished, since
I don't even know how many there are out there. So far all cards covered by
HolQeD are included, (SkyBox Trading Cards 99 [from HQ 3:2 p.9] SP1, SP2,
SP3 [from HQ 3:4 p.10--11], S19, S20, S21 [from HQ 5:2 p.14], S25, S26 and
S27 [from HQ 5:3 p.15].) plus some card transcribed directly (SkyBox
Trading Cards S7, S8, S9, S13, S14, S15). Unfortunately the descriptions in
HolQeD are not detailed enough to guarantee total completeness and lack of
errors. (Even though articles containing corrections [such as HolQeD 4:1
p.7] have been taken into consideration, I still suspect errors.)

The following characters have special meaning in this transcript:

   {...} Indicates a void you are supposed to fill with a Klingon phrase.
         (only used it the CK and PK transcriptions).
   n/a   not available (i.e. no tranlation was given i the source).
   |     is used to separate multiple translations.
   +     follows a word that occurs for the first time in canon in this
         source, or that get an expanded definition in regart to earlier
         sources.
   '     a Klingon letter. Not used for anything else.
   *     surrounds any *emphasised* word (normally written in italics)
         also used for words that are transliterated rather than
         translated, such as *bat'leth* or *d'k tagh*).
   #     surrounds any #non-standard# or #incorrect# Klingon (used mostly
         for dialects or examples illustrating non-standard phonology or
         incorrect grammar).
   ""    signifies a phrase in English, that also is presented in Klingon.
   »«    are used for quotation marks. Usually there is a describing quote
         from the main text, when no direct translation is available in
         that source.
   {}    surrounds all Klingon words and phrases (normally written in
         boldface).
   []    surrounds my own thoughts or opinions, or a general comment about
         something in the source (disturbing sound effect on the tapes,
         grammatical error, wierd translation, whatever). Most often this
         comment is a simple source reference however.
   <>    Indicate a word in the English translation, that is also possible
         to look up in the E-K side of the dictionary.
   «»    Indicate a word in the English translation, which is not possible
         to find in the E-K side of the dictionary, though this *should*
         be the case.
   ¿?    surrounds phrases or words with uncertain spelling, or otherwise
         doubtful entries (mostly names spoken on the tapes, whose
         spelling I have been unable to confirm).

Special thanks for contributions go to:
   Klingon Language institute and their {HelQeD} journal.

This marking represents the Klingon Empire and has been
emblazoned upon the hulls of countless Klingon Starships. During
the aggressive expansion of the Klingon people from their
homeworld of Kronos into space, this symbol grew to become as
feared throughout the galaxy as the menacing profiles of their
battlecruisers.

The Klingon battle knife is designed primarily for versatility of use,
so that the user is never caught at a disadvantage. Two small,
secondary blades eject from the knife's sides, providing both a hand
guard and another set of cutting edges. A brutally spiked pommel
fastens the hilt together to provide a damaging surprise attack or
give a devastating backhand stroke.

Klingon starship design is vastly different from Starfleet technology.
A huge amount of the ship's power and technology is devoted to its
weapons grid and defensive systems. Unlike most Starfleet vessels,
the main viewer on a Klingon ship is usually overlaid with a
complex target acquisition grid.

as {betleH} -- But this may be a canon translation now...]

When a Klingon warrior dies or is killed, other Klingons may perform a
ceremonial howl or yell as part of the Klingon death ritual. The eyes of the
fallen Klingon are opened and others roar i great crescendo. This yell is
victrious in nature, rather than mournful and also serves to warn the other dead
that a Klingon warrior is coming.

The Klingon Painstik is an important part of a Klingon's Age of Ascension
ceremony. The Painstik is employed by friends of the recipent who use the
devices to inflict pain in a manner which will allow the Klingon to attain a
higher state of spirituality as a warrior, proving his mettle. Painstiks are a
little over one meter long and emit a highly-charged shock for the express
purpose of inflicting pain.

[Transcriber's note: In HolQeD the word {'ul} is spelled {'vI} (sic!).]

All Klingon vessels are equipped wth a cloaking device, allowing the ship to fly
in a state of practical invisibility. Cloaking technology was gained through an
alliance with the Romulan Star Empire, possibly in exchange for Warp Drive
technology. Due to the tremendous energy drain of a cloaking device, weapons
cannot be discharged while the cloak is in operation.

[Transcriber's note: In HolQeD {puvlaHbogh Duj ngabmoHlaw'} is incorrectly given
as {puVlaHbogh DujngabmoHlaw'} and the word {romuluSnganpu'vaD} includes an an
extraneous space, {romulu Snganpu'vaD}.]
