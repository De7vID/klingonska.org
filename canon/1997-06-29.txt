I'll take these up one at a time (in separate responses).

The object of  jatlh "speak" is that which is spoken.  Thus, it's OK to say
"speak a language," for example:

        tlhIngan Hol Dajatlh "you speak Klingon"
        (tlhIngan Hol "Klingon language," Dajatlh "you speak it")

But it's also OK to say "speak an address, speak a lecture," for example:

        SoQ Dajatlh "you speak an address" or, more colloquially, "you
        deliver an address" or "you make a speech"

        (SoQ "speech, lecture, address," Dajatlh "you speak it")

To say simply:

        jatlh "he/she speaks"

implies "he/she speaks it," where "it" is a language or a lecture or
whatever.

The indirect object of jatlh, when expressed, is the hearer/listener.
Thus:

        qama'pu'vaD tlhIngan Hol Dajatlh "you speak Klingon to the prisoners"
        (qama'pu'vaD "for the prisoners," tlhIngan Hol "Klingon language,"
        Dajatlh "you speak it")

        qama'pu'vaD SoQ Dajatlh "you make a speech to the prisoners"
        (qama'pu'vaD "for the prisoners," SoQ "speech, lecture, address,"
        Dajatlh "you speak it")

When the indirect object (in this case, the hearer) is first or second
person, the pronominal prefix which normally indicates first or second
person object may be used.  There are other examples of this sort of thing
with other verbs.  For example, someone undergoing the Rite of Ascension
says:

        tIqwIj Sa'angnIS "I must show you [plural] my heart"
        (tIqwIj "my heart," Sa'angnIS "I must show you [plural] it")

The pronominal prefix in this phrase is Sa-, which means "I [do something
to] all of you" in such sentences as:

        Salegh "I see you [plural]"

but when there's already an object (in this case, tIqwIj "my heart"), the
"object" of the prefix is interpreted as the indirect object, so Sa- means
"I [do something to] it for you" or the like.

This, then, brings us back to your question.  Since the object of jatlh is
that which is spoken, and since "you" or "I" or "we" cannot be spoken (and
therefore cannot be the object of the verb), if the verb is used with a
pronominal prefix indicating a first- or second-person object, that first
or second person is the indirect object.

Which is a not very elegant way of saying that qajatlh means "I speak to
you" or, more literally, perhaps "I speak it to you," where "it" is a
language or a speech or whatever:

        qajatlh "I speak to you"

        Sajatlh "I speak to you [plural]"

        chojatlh "you speak to me"

        tlhIngan Hol qajatlh "I speak Klingon to you"
        (tlhIngan Hol "Klingon language," qajatlh "I speak it to you") 

There's another wrinkle to this.  The verb jatlh can also be used when
giving direct quotations:

        tlhIngan jIH jatlh "he/she says, 'I am a Klingon'"
        (tlhIngan "Klingon," jIH "I," jatlh "speak")

        jatlh tlhIngan jIH "he/she says, 'I am a Klingon'"

(With verbs of saying, such as jatlh, the phrase that is being said or
cited may come before or after the verb.)

If the speaker is first or second person, the pronominal prefix indicating
"no object" is used:

        tlhIngan jIH jIjatlh "I say, 'I am a Klingon'"
        (jIjatlh "I speak")

        tlhIngan jIH bIjatlh "you say, 'I am a Klingon'"
        (bIjatlh "you speak")

There are instances where the pronominal prefix marks a big distinction in
meaning:

        tlhIngan Hol Dajatlh "you speak Klingon"
        (tlhIngan Hol "Klingon language," Dajatlh "you speak it")

        tlhIngan Hol bIjatlh "you say, 'Klingon language'" [that is "you say
        the phrase 'Klingon language'"]
        (tlhIngan Hol "Klingon language," bIjatlh "you speak")

I realize that this answer to your "quick" question is probably too quick
itself.  It is not by any means a complete discussion of the several topics
mentioned and I may have phrased things not as clearly as they might be
phrased.  As a result, this answer may end up just raising other questions.
qay'be'.  We'll get to them as they come along.

I agree that a "complete" (or at least "as complete as possible") Klingon
Dictionary would be a good thing to have.  In fact, I'd been mulling over
something sort of along those lines as a next project for me (and for
Maltz, of course).  There are currently, however, no official or concrete
plans to come out with one, but as long as interest in Klingon (language
and culture and history and so on) remains high (as it certainly is now),
anything's possible.

Actually, I tried to "pursue" the meaning of qIvon.  Maltz seemed a little
reluctant to talk about it.  (I'd say "embarrassed," but that word is
entirely inappropriate to use in describing a Klingon.)  The next time the
bloodwine is flowing freely, I'll try to remember to bring it up again. 
But I've noticed that, for me, anyway, bloodwine and memory don't mix.

Regarding "tonight" and so forth, I'd go along with your suggestion:

DaHjaj ram "tonight" (literally "today night" or "today's night")

DaHjaj po "this morning" (literally "today morning" or "today's morning")

DaHjaj pov "this afternoon" (literally "today afternoon" or "today's
afternoon")

DaHjaj DungluQ "this noon" (literally "today noon" or "today's noon") 

DaHjaj ramjep "this midnight" (literally "today midnight" or "today's
midnight")

DaHjaj pemjep "this midday" (literally "today midday" or "today's midday") 

(The phrases "this noon," "this midnight," and "this midday" are a little
awkward in English -- we'd probably say "today at noon," "tonight at
midnight," "today in the middle of the day" or something -- but in Klingon,
they fall right into place.)

In Klingon, you could even say DaHjaj pem "today's daytime," which would
probably be typically contrasted with DaHjaj ram "today's night" (or
"tonight").

wa'leS po "tomorrow morning," cha'leS po "the morning of the day after
tomorrow" (literally "two-days-from-now morning"), and so on work quite
nicely.

Adding -vam "this" to most words designating fixed periods of time seems to
be the only way to indicate "current."  Thus the current year or "this
year" is DISvam (referring, of course, to a Klingon year, or DIS), the
current month or "this month" is jarvam (jar "[Klingon] month"), and the
current week or "this week" is Hoghvam (Hogh "[Klingon] week").  There
don't seem to be special words for "the current year" and so forth
comparable to DaHjaj "the current day" or "today."  DaHjaj seems to be
formed of the adverbial DaH "now" plus the noun jaj "day," a unique type of
formation as far as I know.  It is perhaps by analogy to DISvam, jarvam,
etc. -- all formed by simply adding a noun suffix to a noun -- that
Klingons also refer to the current day as jajvam "this day" (jaj "day,
period from dawn to dawn").

Though they both can be translated "today," DaHjaj and jajvam are not quite
interchangeable.  As the time element in a sentence, DaHjaj (and not
jajvam) is used:

	DaHjaj romuluSngan vIHoHpu' "today I killed a Romulan"
	(DaHjaj "today," romuluSngan "Romulan," vIHoHpu' "I have killed 
	him/her")

As the subject of a sentence, on the other hand, jajvam is more typically
found:

	nI' jajvam "this day is long"
	(nI' "[it] is long [in duration], jajvam "this day")

though DaHjaj is not impossible:

	nI' DaHjaj "today is long"
	(nI' "[it] is long [in duration], DaHjaj "today")

DaHjaj also behaves as a noun (as opposed to an adverbial element) in such
noun-noun constructions as  DaHjaj gheD "today prey" or "today's prey," a
term often heard in Klingon restaurants with a meaning comparable to "catch
of the day."

Phrases such as jajvam po "this day morning" or "this morning" are not
common, but they're not ungrammatical either.
