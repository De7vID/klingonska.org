Subject: gods (from Marc)              |

From the startrek.klingon news group:

There is a Klingon word that could be translated "god" or
"supernatural being":  <Qun>.

In talking of times long ago (pre-Kahless?), Klingons
mention these beings, and there seem to have been a good
number of them (the plural of <Qun> is <Qunpu'> since they
are or were presumably capable of using language, which is
what the plural suffix <-pu'> implies).  Though too little
is known of ancient Klingon theology, there doesn't seem to
have been a single <Qun> that stood out from the rest.
Indeed, the <Qunpu'> appear to have acted collectively.

<Qunpu'> are distinct from <qa'pu'> "spirits" (such as the
spirits of the dishonored dead which reside at Gre'thor).

<Qun'a'> "great god" (<Qun> plus <-'a'>, the augmentative
suffix) may or may not be an appropriate translation for a
single supernatural being in a monotheistic system, since
the <Qun'a'> would still be one among many.

{chegh} "return" seems to work like this:

lupDujHomDaq jIchegh    "I return on the shuttle."

lupDujHom vIchegh       "I return to the shuttle."

lupDujHomDaq may'Duj vIchegh  "I return to the battle
cruiser on the shuttle"

tera'vo' Qo'noS vIchegh  "I return to Kronos from Earth"


({lupDujHom} "shuttle," {-Daq} "locative suffix," {jIchegh}
"I return" consisting of {jI-} "I" [no object] plus {chegh}
"return"; {vIchegh} "I return to" consisting of {vI-} "I
[do something to] it" plus {chegh} "return [to]"; {may'Duj}
"battle cruiser"; {tera'} "Earth," {-vo'} "from", {Qo'noS}
"Kronos")

Note that {chegh} "return" means "return to a place"; the
place being returned to is the object of the verb.  If the
place being returned to is not mentioned (as in, for
example, the first sentence above, "I return on the
shuttle"), the verb takes a prefix indicating "no object"
(here {jI-}). If the place being returned to is mentioned
(as in the final three sentences), the verb takes a
pronominal prefix that indicates the object ({vI-} in the
examples).

A different verb, {tatlh}, is used for "return" in the
sense of returning a library book or returning a weapon to
the weapons rack.

If someone were to say something like "I return the plate
to the table," the appropriate verb would be {tatlh}:

    raSDaq jengva' vItatlh

({raS} "table," {-Daq} "locative suffix," {jengva'}
"plate," {vItatlh} "I return it" consisting of {vI-} "I [do
something to] it" plus {tatlh} "return")

Though not common, it is also possible to use {tatlh} with
the reflexive suffix {-'egh} ("do something to oneself") to
convey a meaning similar to that of {chegh}:

    pa'Daq jItatlh'egh  "I return to the room"

({pa'} "room," {-Daq} "locative suffix," jItatlh'egh "I
return myself" consisting of {jI-} "I," {tatlh} "return,"
{'egh} "reflexive suffix")

The {tatlh'egh} form seems to suggest that the doer of the
action is
forcing himself/herself to do something, perhaps because it
is difficult or not desirable.

Subject: where do you live? (from Marc)  |

Actually, the most common form of the question "Where do
you live?" is not a question at all, but a command such as:

Daq DaDabbogh yIngu'    "Identify the place where you live"

(<Daq> "place"; <DaDabbogh> "that you live at," made up of
<Da-> "you [do something to] it," <Dab> "live in/at, dwell
in/at, inhabit" <-bogh> "relative clause marker"; yIngu'
"identify it!" consisting of <yI-> "imperative prefix,"
<ngu'> "identify")

Perhaps a translation such as "Identify the place that you
live at" or "Identify the place that you inhabit" is more
revealing.

Answers are likely to be brief and to the point:

Daqvam "this place"  (<Daq> "place," <-vam> "this")
pa'    "there"
naDev  "here"
qachvetlh "that building"  (<qach> "building," <-vetlh>
"that")
Qo'noS    "Kronos"

It is possible, however, to respond with a full sentence:

Daqvam vIDab     "I live at this place"
pa' vIDab        "I live there"
naDev vIDab      "I live here"
qachvetlh vIDab  "I live in/at that building"
Qo'noS vIDab     "I live on Kronos"

(<vIDab> "I live in/at," consisting of <vI-> "I [do
something to] it," <Dab> "live in/at, dwell in/at,
inhabit")

Of the three suggested ways to ask "Where do you live?" the
first is the most acceptable:

nuq DaDab    "What do you inhabit? What do you dwell at?"

(<nuq> "what?"; <DaDab> "you live in/at it, you dwell in/at
it, you inhabit it," containing the prefix <Da-> "you [do
something to] it")

The English translations of <nuq DaDab> are very awkward
(from an English point of view) and don't get across the
sense of the Klingon all that well.  The less literal
"Where do you live?" is what is really being asked.
In Klingon, when one lives in a place or dwells in a place,
he or she is thought of as "occupying" or "inhabiting" that
place; not doing something at that location, but doing
something to it (occupying it).
