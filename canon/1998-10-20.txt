Subject: Re: The spelling of the name of a weapon and the Klingon alphbet.

The various contributors to this thread have pretty much said all there is to
say about /betleH/ and its various Federation spellings (bat'telh, bat'leth). 
But I'll add a little anyway. 

>From the point of view of the Klingon language, the word is /betleH/.  This
is not an official "spelling" (the only official spelling would be in Klingon
characters); it's just a standardized transcription of spoken Klingon that
tells the reader how to pronounce the word (or at least gives a close
approximation). 

When the word was originally written down by Federation scouts (or whoever
the first Federation folks were who tried to write it down), the details of
the Klingon language were unknown and there were undoubtedly some mishearings
and/or mistranscriptions.  Some early transcriber(s) apparently wrote
"bat'telh" while another (or others) wrote "bat'leth."  The first may have
been a mishearing of (or been influenced by) Klingon /batlh 'etlh/, literally
"sword of honor," while the second may have been an attempt to write
/betleH/, with its decidedly non-Federation Standard final consonant. 

The spelling "bat'telh" apparently got passed around a lot and became a
common way to write the word.  Since almost no one in the Federation, at that
time, had heard the word spoken by a Klingon, they would have no way to know
whether "bat'telh" was the best choice.  For some reason, later on, the
alternate spelling, "bat'leth," came to be used more frequently than
"bat'telh" and eventually it came to be the accepted one for use in the
Federation. 

As a result of the spelling "bat'leth," many non-Klingons call the weapon by
a name that resembles that spelling (they say "BAT-leth") rather than by
something closer to the actual Klingon /betleH/.  This (sort of) parallels
referring to the Russian capital as Moscow in English rather than using the
Russian pronunciation "moskva."  The point is that "Moscow" is an acceptable
English way to pronounce the name of the city, but it's not the Russian way. 
Similarly, "bat'leth" is an acceptable Federation Standard way to pronounce
the name of the weapon, but it's not the Klingon way. 

[The "real" story, of course, is a little different.  The first time the word
ever comes up in Star Trek, as far as I know, is in the Next Generation
episode "Reunion."  In that script (and others), it is spelled "bat'telh," so
that is where that spelling in Star Trek books and so forth comes from.  When
the word is actually pronounced in the episode, however, Worf says something
more like "BAT-leH" (where "H"  is a harsh sound similar to the "ch" in
German "Bach"), and eventually scripts started spelling the word "bat'leth," 
which seems a fusion of the original spelling and the pronunciation. 
Similarly, publications about Star Trek used the "bat'telh" spelling for a
while, but now everyone seems to have switched over to "bat'leth."]

Though there is no question that medical services are sometimes necessary,
Klingons have a feeling of uneasiness when it comes to anything associated
with medicine.  Furthermore, to a Klingon, finding oneself in need of the
care of a doctor is often considered a disgraceful state of affairs. 

Nevertheless, Klingon doctors do exist, as do various sorts of aides, but the
division of labor in Klingon hospitals, sick bays, and the like is not quite
parallel to that in the Federation.  As a result, the vocabulary associated
with medical practitioners is not quite parallel to its Federation
counterpart. 

The general word for "doctor" or "physician" is /Qel/.  A doctor who performs
surgery is a /HaqwI'/ "surgeon."  The two terms are not mutually exclusive;
that is, the same individual may be referred to as both a /Qel/ and a
/HaqwI'/.  It is reasonable to say /HaqwI' po' ghaH Qel'e'/ "the doctor is a
skilled surgeon" (/po'/ "be skilled,"  /ghaH/ "he/she," /-'e'/ topic suffix). 

There is no single term for "nurse," as distinguished from "physician's
assistant."  Voragh's suggestions (/Qel boQ/ "doctor's aide," /HaqwI' boQ/
"surgeon's aide") are fine and both could be used.  Qov's suggestion,
/QelHom/, consisting of /Qel/ "doctor" plus the diminutive suffix /-Hom/, is
also an acceptable form (and is an excellent illustration of the diminutive
suffix -- the word means "not quite a doctor" or "lesser doctor" or the
like). 

Another word sometimes applied to the person a Federation patient might refer
to as a "nurse" is /rachwI'/.  The verb /rach/ has been translated variously
as "invigorate,"  "fortify," and "strengthen."  Thus /rachwI'/ (/rach/ plus
the suffix /-wI'/ "one who does") is an "invigorator, fortifier,
strengthener."  When used in reference to a person, the verb /rach/ suggests
an improvement in health;  when used in reference to an inanimate object,
say, a mechanical device or the hull of a ship, /rach/ also implies
improvement or betterment. 

/rach/ is to be distinguished from /tI'/ "repair" in two ways: (1) /tI'/ is
generally not applied to living beings;  (2) /tI'/ suggests restoration to a
previous state, not necessarily improvement.  /rach/ is also to be
distinguished from /Dub/ "improve," which seems to be used primarily when
what is being enhanced is of a more abstract nature (as when one improves or
increases one's status, skill, understanding, etc.).
