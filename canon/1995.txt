[2000­07­13] Reformatted from earlier file.
[2000­07­30] Compared text with the actual cards.
[2004-01-08] added missing last aphostophe on one occurance of
     {qItI'nga} in the S15 SkyBox Card (thanx to Steven Lytle
     <MorphemeAddict@wmconnect.com> for pointing it out!)

Special thanks go to Nancy Nielsen­Brown for actually *giving* me all the
SkyBox cards listed in this file (at the {qep'a' SochDIch}).

The cards included here are:
  S13, S14, S15 [TNG 3rd season]

These cards have been included in SkyBox series of collectible trading
cards, with one set of cards being produced for each season of TNG. In each
such batch tree cards have featured Klingon text, with translations made by
Dr. Marc Okrand. I've heard that SkyBox never got Paramount's permission to
use the language during the show's seventh season, but there also seem to be
a contradictory rumor stating that there were actually three more cards
produced (supposedly in 1997 or 1998).

Line breaks have been inserted only where they occur in the original.

the most important Klingon virtues. Above all, the Klingon family
name is highly valued.

The Klingon disruptor rifle is a standard hand held
disruptor, attached to an extended power supply stock.
This serves to steady the aim of a warrior and increase
the effective range for distance targeting.
