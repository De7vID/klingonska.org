nuqneH?

This is just a quick note to welcome everybody to this bbs.  I'm looking 
forward to hearing (rather, seeing) what you think about the Klingon language, 
what works, what frustrates you, what you're up to, and so on.

There are more and more people communicating in Klingon these days, some of 
them very expertly and some just beginning to get their tongues in shape.  In 
order to include everybody, I'll be writing in Federation Standard most of the 
time.  But if you want to write in Klingon, please do!

DaH maloS.  peghItlh!

Qapla'!

Lisa --
You are right, of course.  The Klingon word for "growl" isn't in the 
dictionary.  Likewise "jealous." That doesn't mean that these words don't 
exist -- we just haven't learned them yet.  In the meantime, I think the best 
approach is to follow the advice of d'Armond Speers (in his response to your 
note) and use what we do know in creative ways.

Let us know what you come up with!

PS -- The Klingon word for "smile" is mon.  This also means things like 
"snarl" and "smirk." I wouldn't be surprised to find a Klingon mon and growl 
at the same time, but mon by itself doesn't describe the full growling 
experience.

d'Armond --
jIQochbe'.  When the dictionary lacks a word that you need (or think you 
need), the best approach is to think of other ways to say the same thing.  
This not only gets your idea across, it also helps you become more familiar 
with Klingon. qeS QaQ.
