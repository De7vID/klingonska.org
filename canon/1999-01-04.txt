No reason for me to add anything here!  This is a good 
illustration of the use of the verb <rur> "resemble." 

The word <rur> also comes up a lot in Klingon similes, such
as <'up; yIH rur> "(it's) disgusting as a tribble,"
literally "it's disgusting; it resembles a tribble" (<'up>
"it is disgusting," <yIH> "tribble," <rur> "it resembles
[it]").

Qermaq's suggestion to use the verb <tlhej> "accompany" as
a way to get across the notion of "with" in the sentence
meaning "he went with them" is exactly right.

Its use is not restricted to the notion of going someplace
("accompany" in the sense of "go with").  It is fine to say
such things as:

    'Iw HIq vItlhutlh.  mutlhej ghaH.

"He/she drinks bloodwine with me," literally "I drink
bloodwine.  He/she accompanies me" (<'Iw HIq> "bloodwine,"
<vItlhutlh> "I drink it," <mutlhej> "he/she/they
accompanies/accompany me," <ghaH> "he, she").
