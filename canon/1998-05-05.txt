I'll avoid entering into this bout of {mu'qaD veS} "curse warfare" even
though it's a grand Klingon tradition.  I will, however, add a little bit
to Qermaq's terrific example of the art. 

The Klingon word for "fork" is {puq chonnaQ}. 

As is well known, Klingons prefer to get food into their mouths without
the aid of implements (except for such things as the bowl containing soup
or the goblet containing bloodwine).  Nevertheless, they have become
acquainted with the eating habits of other cultures and have become aware
of such things as forks.  On occasion, they'll even use the implements,
most commonly when partaking of a non-Klingon meal (whether on a Klingon
planet or elsewhere) but sometimes when eating Klingon food, as if to add
an exotic touch to the meal experience.  (Not all Klingons are skilled in
using forks, however, and some simply refuse to deal with them.  Those who
do not use them seem to be not at all troubled by eating "foreign" food
using Klingon means -- that is, hands.) 

The term {puq chonnaQ} is, at least in origin, somewhat derisive.  It
literally means "child's hunting spear,"  suggesting that the eating
implement is small and not very effective (though the actual child's
spear, as opposed to the "fork," is useful for training in the art of
hunting). 

The Klingon word for "spoon" is {baghneQ}.  Even though spoons were never
typically used when eating, the word appears to have been in the language
for a long time, suggesting that it may once have meant something else. 
One theory is that it comes from {nagh beQ} "flat stone, flat rock" and
that the initial sounds of the two words, {n} and {b}, were, for some
reason, transposed.  This is, however, just speculation.

I'm glad you (and your friends) are enjoying the Klingon CD.  And thanks
to others who responded (more quickly than I!) to this posting and listed
the various books and tapes available. 

Having said that, I'm not sure which CD you've got! 

There are (to the best of my knowledge) two or three Klingon language CDs,
depending on how you count: 

Disk 3 of the three-disk CD-ROM set "Star Trek: Klingon"  contains the
Klingon Language Lab (CD-ROM) and also a portion of "Power Klingon" (which
can be played as a regular audio CD), available in its full form on
audiocassette.  (So this can count as either one or two CDs.) 

There is also a CD version of "Conversational Klingon"  (originally
produced as an audiocassette) that was distributed in the "Emissary Gift
Set" several years ago.  I don't know if it's available separately.  This
gift set also contained the Next Generation "Interactive Technical Manual"
(CD-ROM), a preview version of the CD-ROM game "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine
Harbinger," and a videotape of the pilot episode of DS9, "Emissary." 

If there was a Klingon language CD of some kind included in the Omnipedia
gift set, I don't know what it was, though I'd love to find out! 

As for additional CDs -- as of now, I've got nothing in the works, but as
long as there are people interested in learning more Klingon.....
