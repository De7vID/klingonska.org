Special thanks go to Nancy Nielsen­Brown for actually *giving* me
all the SkyBox cards listed in this file (at the {qep'a' SochDIch}).

These are the SkyBox International Trading cards that I know of up
to date. It is my intention of placing each in their respective
place in the article "A List of Okrandian Sources", but so far I
have not found the time for it. Rather than not including them at
all, I have choosen to include them in this rather inconsistent
manner. Hopefully I will find the time to change this in the future.

The cards included here are:
  SP1, SP2, SP3 [TNG 1st season]
  S7,  S8,  S9  [TNG 2nd season]
  S19, S20, S21 [TNG 4th season]
  S25, S26, S27 [TNG 5th season]
  S31, S32, S33 [TNG 6th season]

These cards have been included in SkyBox series of collectible
trading cards, with one set of cards being produced for each season
of TNG. In each such batch tree cards have featured Klingon text,
with translations made by Dr. Marc Okrand. I've heard that SkyBox
never got Paramount's permission to use the language during the
show's seventh season, but there also seem to be a contradictory
rumor stating that there were actually three more cards produced
(supposedly in 1997 or 1998).

There is also a SkyBox card no. 99 produced for the first season of
DS9. This card features a text similar to the classic opening voice
over of TOS. The cards was produced in several different versions,
the difference being the language of the text, among the languages
used where English, Japanese and Klingon. (It was available in a
total of five to ten different languages.)

In this file (as in most other) line breaks have been inserted only
where they occur in the original.

This marking represents the Klingon Empire and has been emblazoned
upon the hulls of countless Klingon Starships. During the aggressive
expansion of the Klingon people from their homeworld of Kronos into
space, this symbol grew to become as feared throughout the galaxy as
the menacing profiles of their battlecruisers.

The Klingon battle knife is designed primarily for
versatility of use, so that the user is never caught
at a disadvantage. Two small, secondary blades
eject from the knife's sides, providing both a hand
guard and another set of cutting edges. A brutally
spiked pommel fastens the hilt together to provide
a damaging surprise attack or give a devastating
backhand stroke.

main viewer on a Klingon ship is usually overlaid with a complex target
acquisition grid.

Death Howl
Hegh bey

When a Klingon warrior dies or is killed, other Klingons may perform a
ceremonial howl or yell as part of the Klingon death ritual. The eyes of the
fallen Klingon are opened and others roar in a great crescendo. This yell
is victorious in nature, rather than mournful and also serves to warn the
other dead that a Klingon warrior is coming.

Painstik

The Klingon Painstik is an important part of a Klingon's Age of Ascension ceremony. The Painstik is employed by friends
of the recipent who use the devices to inflict pain in a manner which will allow the Klingon to attain a higher state of
spirituality as a warrior, proving his mettle. Painstiks are a little over one meter long and emit a highly­charged shock
for the express purpose of inflicting pain.

Cloaking Device
So'wI'

All Klingon vessels are equipped with a cloaking device, allowing the ship to fly in a
state of practical invisibility. Cloaking technology was gained through an alliance with
the Romulan Star Empire, possibly in exchange for Warp Drive technology. Due to the
tremendous energy drain of a cloaking device, weapons cannot be discharged while the
cloak is in operation.
