According to Maltz, there are at least a couple of ways to identify a
Klingon's house (or <tuq>).

One way is the way you suggested.  To say "Kahlor of the House of Molor"
(or, if you prefer, "Kahlor from the House of Molor"), you'd say simply
"Kahlor, House of Molor":

    qeylor molor tuq

If you want to be even more formal, the name of the father may be used as
well -- again, as you suggested.  "Kahlor, son of Kahlin, of the House of
Molor" is "Kahlor, son of Kahlin, House of Molor":

    qeylor qeylIn puqloD molor tuq

The other way is actually more formal and a bit formulaic.  To say "Kahlor
is of the House of Molor" (or "Kahlor is from the House of Molor"), you
could say:

    tay' qeylor molor tuq je

This is literally "Kahlor and the House of Molor are together" (<tay'> "be
together," <je> "and").  The construction is no doubt based on the Klingon
proverb "One is always of his tribe" (literally, "a person and his house
are always together"):

    reH tay' ghot tuqDaj je

(<reH> "always," <ghot> "person," <tuqDaj> "his/her house")

If Kahlor is speaking, he could say, "I am of the House of Molor": 

    matay' jIH molor tuq je

Or if one were speaking to Kahlor, one could say, "You are of the House of
Molor":

    Sutay' SoH molor tuq je

Literally, these are "The House of Molor and I are together" (<matay'> "we
are together," <jIH> "I," <molor tuq> "House of Molor," <je> "and"), "The
House of Molor and you are together" (<Sutay'> "you [plural] are together,"
<SoH> "you").  The independent pronouns (<jIH> "I" and <SoH> "you" in the
examples above) are always used in this construction.

Good question!

I didn't have my oscilloscope handy when Maltz was explaining all of this. 
Nor my tricorder, which I suspect would have done an even better job of
analysis.

I'm not a musical theorist, but from what I can figure, the first <yu> and
the next <yu> are not an octave apart; they are a nonave apart.

Does that help?

(Actually, I suspect it's more like the charghwI' version -- though I'd
have to hear it and run it by Maltz again to be sure.)

There's a bit more about all of this in the new book "Klingon For the
Galactic Traveler" (pages 184-185), but I (and what it says in the book)
agree with what Neal wrote.

It is not infrequent to hear nonnative speakers of Klingon use <nuqneH>
"what do you want?" as if it meant "hello" or the like in exchanges such
as:

 Speaker #1: nuqneH

 Speaker #2: nuqneH

No one steeped in Klingon culture would do this, however (except in some
sort of a joking context, perhaps).  To begin a conversation, just start!
Or approach someone and wait for him/her to say <nuqneH> to you.  If that
person doesn't say anything, you probably don't want to talk to him/her
anyway.

Subject: Re: qIb lengwI' tlhIngan Hol

Thanks for the nice words about the new book.  I'm impressed that some of
the new vocabulary there is already incorporated into these postings.

SuStel charghwI' je -- muquvmoH QInmey DalI'pu'bogh tlhIH.

As for how to use <Sum> "be near, nearby" -- that will require some more
time with Maltz.

Do' Sum matlh.

I would think, however, that it would work the same way as <Hop> "be far."

I'll see what Maltz has to say.
