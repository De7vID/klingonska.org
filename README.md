Klingon](http://klingonska.org/songs/) etc.

Currently Happening
-------------------
We're currently (since July 1, 2012) rolling out a major site re-design. This
means adding a new look to the pages, as well as changing into a fully
automated build system. As we, slowly, painstakingly, convert all pages into
the new format, you'll see the new red page header take over, until it is
*everywhere*.

Don't worry, we are not about to remove any content.
