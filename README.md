Klingonska Akademien
====================
[Klingonska Akademien][main] is a large reference site for the Klingon
language. It contains an extensive [dictionary][dict] (with translations into
both Swedish and English), an archive of all text written on Klingon by its
creator Marc Okrand ([Archive of Okrandian Canon][canon], and lots of articles
about various other stuff, such as [the Klingon alphabet][piqad], [songs in
Klingon](http://klingonska.org/songs/) etc.


Currently Happening
-------------------
March 3, 2013: The [Klingon Glossary Extractor & Flashcards][glossary] should
now be quite usable. The flashcard algorithm was changed so that only a small
number of words are practised at any one time, with new words being added as
you learn the first ones. Feedback is greatly appreciated (use
[email][webmaster], or [GitHub Issue Tracking][issue]).

November 15, 2012: Building a new learning tool for beginners. The tool,
preliminarily called [Klingon Glossary Extractor][glossary], can be used to
automatically analyze any Klingon text and extract a glossary from it. It also
keeps track of which words a user already know, so that he/she quickly can
estimate how many unknown words there are in any given text. Ultimately there
will be a flashcard feature for learning the new words as well. The program is
not quite ready for official release (the flashcards part is still missing),
but you're free to try it out. (Comments and suggestions are muchly
appreciated.)

September 7, 2012: Rolling out the new design is taking its time, but as of now
most pages have the new look (except for some old, rarely used ones, and pages
served by CGI). Work will continue, but for now we'll concentrate on more
interesting stuff. There also was a major re-write of [**pIqaD**, And How to
Read It][piqad], with improved pronunciation info, info on dialects etc.

July 1, 2012: We're currently rolling out a major site re-design. This means
adding a new look to the pages, as well as changing into a fully automated
build system. As we, slowly, painstakingly, convert all pages into the new
format, you'll see the new red page header take over, until it is *everywhere*.

Don't worry, we are not about to remove any content.
