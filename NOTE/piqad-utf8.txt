All you need to do is to download and install the Code2000 font, and
set your browser Preferences to use it. Instructions for Windows are

You may need to tell your e-mail software to use Unicode UTF-8.

Look Inside This Book at Amazon shows that some word for thunder
occurs three times in the Klingon Hamlet, but I have not determined
which Klingon word it is.
