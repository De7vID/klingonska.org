Priorities:
1) IMPORTANT -- page visibly broken in bad way (bad link or somesuch) or
   new, very important information (like a new word in dictionary)
2) ugly -- page has minor flaw which looks unprofessional (but works)
3) EASY -- change or addition, material exists but is not shown/wasted
4) WANTED -- could be better, but is okay
5) MAYBE -- would be nice to have, but needs to be though about

** DONE Web redirects
   http://klingonska.org/~USER -> external site
   LRC emailed, asking why is redirect had stopped working 2010-09-07,
   notifying me of the problem. I realized that there were settings in an old
   Apache .htaccess file I had forgot to take into consideration in the new
   HCoop setup. I copied the relevant rewriteRules from the Apache file to
   HCoop's domtool, and web redirects seem to be up and working again.

* Site content
** TODO Do a surf-through check for weird/old shit
** TODO Systematic/site-wide changes
   I.e. changes that need to be applied to the web page as a whole.
*** TODO Linking Klingon phrases to English translation?
    Is there a microdata for this? Should one surround the phrases using <span>
    like this: <span><b lang="tlh">ya'Da ya'Da</b> <i class="transl">yadda
    yadda</i></span> ? Or maybe use some identifier, which is the same between
    the two phrases, but otherwise unique in the document, as an attribute
    value?

    Regardless: Can this be autogenerated from Markdown? (Without building
    *too* much intelligence into the Markdown->HTML processor...)

*** TODO [#3] Re-point old URLs modern day web page
    http://come.to/klingonska/
*** TODO Replace <tt> with <code> (or whatever is appropriate)
*** TODO Check HTML comments (and remove unnecessary ones)
*** TODO "page.css" should be included by all pages(?)
*** TODO [#4] Site search
    Using google? Chrome should autodetect this.
*** TODO [#2] Fix icons & broken images
    http://klingonska.org/lektioner/
    http://klingonska.org/lektioner/gammalt/
    http://klingonska.org/lektioner/ref/
*** TODO Use microdata where applicable
    Where is this? Page datestamps? Page geolocation? Are there more?

    When occuring in text:
**** Author names
**** Source references
*** TODO CC licence on entire site (except KLO?)
*** TODO Add "lang" attribute to <html> tag on all pages
*** TODO Lower-case all HTML
*** TODO Make sure all tags have their corresponding end tag
    E.g. <p>...</p> and <meta ... />.
*** TODO Quote all attribute values
*** TODO "Typographical" quotes
*** TODO Feedback form at end of each page (again)
    This is the old code, using SSI:

    <!-- ================== Feedback Form ================== -->
    <!-- [2007-07-15] Below stuff disabled in move to ManuFrog -->
    <!-- (remove spaces before "#" to re-enable) -->
    <!--#include virtual="/feedback.cgi"
    --><!--#if expr="!$X_NOLOG"
    --><!--#include virtual="/.log.cgi"
    --><!--#endif -->

*** TODO Switch to HTML5(?)
    Read up on the stuff here:
    http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/08/04/designing-a-html-5-layout-from-scratch/
**** TODO Benefit - Autofocus for forms
**** TODO Benefit - Place holder text for forms
*** TODO Optimize jpeg images
    Johan at work mentioned that JPEGs can be radically shrunk by optimizing
    the hash tables in them.
*** DONE Replace <strong lang="tlh"> with <b lang="tlh">
    CLOSED: [2011-07-03 Sun 18:19]
*** DONE Mark all Klingon with <b lang="tlh">...</b>
    CLOSED: [2011-07-04 Mon 09:37]
*** TODO Disable word-wrap for naked Klingon affixes
    Use 'class="affix"', e.g. <b lang="tlh" class="affix">...</b>.

    Naked suffixes (e.g. {-moH}) (in e.g. dict/suffix.html) are sometimes
    wordwrapped, causing the hyphen to occur on a line of its own, and the
    suffix to come first on the following line. Like this:

        text text -
        moH text text

    That looks ugly. Such suffixes should have a class of "affix" and a
    stylesheet preventing wordwrap (i.e. "white-space: nowrap;").

    NOTE: Previously used Unicode character for non-breaking hyphen, but this
    is bad -- since that means one cannot search for them on a page using the
    ^F browser function.
*** TODO Replace <em>...</em> for translation with <i class="transl">...</i>
*** TODO Mark translated phrases with <i class="transl">...</i>
    What should be the markup? 'class="transl"'? No "lang" attribute
    generally be necessary, since it would (usually) be the same language as
    the surrounding text.
*** TODO Title page
**** [#5] Time limited displaying of new pages?
     Add some thing (javascript?) to indicate pages that have been recently
     updated This should maybe be displayed as "New!" for a week, and "New"
     (with less exclamation marks) for a month, or somesuch.

     This is remnant markup from an earlier such thought:

     <tr><td align=right valign=center><img src="/pic/ny.gif" width=31 height=14 alt="Ny" hspace=5></td>
     <tr><td align=right valign=center><img src="/pic/andrad.gif" width=54 height=14 alt="Ã„ndrad" hspace=5></td>
     <tr><td align=right valign=center><img src="/pic/dot.gif" width=15 height=14 alt="*" hspace=5></td>
*** TODO CSS-based design

     for layout.
**** DONE Implement CSS for main menu page
     CLOSED: [2011-04-10 Sun 19:45]

*** TODO <p> tag should default to align=justify
*** TODO Same style for all source references
    E.g. "(published in <B>HolQeD</B> 2:2 pp.10&ndash;11)" (from
    http://klingonska.org/piqad/).

    Use microdata? Use standardized abbbreviation style -- what should it look
    like? Include chapter number where possible (e.g. TKD)?

        <{HolQeD} 2:2>, pp.10--12
        <{HolQeD} 2:2> (pp.10--12)
        <{HolQeD} 2:2> (pages 10--12)

     CLOSED: [2011-07-02 Sat 22:28]

     CLOSED: [2011-06-14 Tue 10:34]
     (and "Uppdaterad" not "Ã„ndrad" in Swedish)
** TODO Pages to add
*** TODO RSS/Atom feed for updates
    http://klingonska.org/feed.atom

    Should be based on information from git, include description and links to all
    changed (browsable) pages. If the dictionary updates, link should point to
    dict/lexicon.cgi. Maybe make a list of file relations?

*** TODO [#4] Add "site news"/updated page
    This should be tied in to "git push" updating process, and not require any
    separate maintenance. It should use log messages, but also include list of
    files + links to files whose contents has beeen updated.
*** TODO [#3] Klingon language apps/software page
    I.e. dictionary apps for Palm, Android etc. Flash card programs for various
    platforms. Programs strictly focused on the Klingon *language*.

*** TODO Script/Apache config
**** DONE Allow only "authorized" access to TKD/TKW/KGT/CK/PK transcripts
     CLOSED: [2011-04-10 Sun 02:36]
     The following pages should not be accessible directly:

     http://klingonska.org/canon/1992-01-01-tkd.txt
     http://klingonska.org/canon/1996-05-01-tkw.txt
     http://klingonska.org/canon/1997-11-01-kgt.txt
     http://klingonska.org/canon/1992-10-01-ck.txt
     http://klingonska.org/canon/1993-10-01-pk.txt

     Make an invisible redirect to a CGI that deals with "authentication" -- if
     user is "authenticated" -- serves the transcript data. This script sets a
     cookie which is retained throughout the site (so only the first transcript
     request requires auth).

     The form should state explicitly that it uses cookies.

***** DONE Apache config(?)
      CLOSED: [2011-04-10 Sun 02:36]
****** DONE Make script work under redirect on HCoop
       CLOSED: [2011-04-10 Sun 02:35]
       The following rewrite rule in ~/.domtool/klingonska.org did the trick:

           (* transcripts requiring authentication for access *)
           rewriteRule "^/canon/([^/]*-(tkd|tkw|kgt|ck|pk)\.txt)$" "/canon/show.cgi?file=$1" [last];
****** DONE Block/rewrite accesses to TKD/KGT/TKW transcripts
       CLOSED: [2010-03-24 Thu 10:28]
       The following Apache config seem to work excellently:

           RewriteEngine On
           RewriteRule /canon/([^/]*-(tkd|tkw|kgt|ck|pk).txt)$ canon/show.cgi?file=$1 [last]

       This will case redirects so that:
           http://klingonska.org/canon/1992-01-01-tkd.txt

       Is rewritten to:
           http://klingonska.org/canon/show.cgi?file=1992-01-01-tkd.txt

****** DONE Write script for showing transcripts
       CLOSED: [2011-04-09 Sat 21:57]
       Name: canon/show.cgi

       This script works the same as the old download.cgi, but also stores a
       cookie. If user already has valid cookie, no login procedure is
       required.
**** TODO Search engine improvements (canon/search/index.cgi)
***** TODO [#2] Review/improve match listings
      This should, preferably, be as similar as possible to the list of sources
      in the main article. Try to imitate Google search results in appearance?
***** TODO Add Chrome integration (some sort of open protocol?)
      Most sites search functions (e.g. YouTube, Wikipedia etc.) are
      automatically detected by Chrome, so that you can auto-complete the site
      name in the navigation bar, and then automatically do a search on that
      site without first having to visit it.

      I want that for klingonska!

      How is this done? Is it some kind of microformat that makes Chrome detect
      search engines?

***** TODO Query prefix "file:" to search only a specific file
      This should allow globs and comma-separated file names, e.g.
      "file:*holqed*", "file:*email,*news" etc.
***** TODO List of files should be available
***** TODO Source file display should allow choice between original/corrected version
      When displaying files, should implement button to change between
      "original", "corrected" and "difference" views of the same text.

      JavaScript version for this is there:
      NOTE/2010-09-01-original+corrected-display/index.html

      NOTE: <noscript> alternative is implemented in above HTML, but needs CGI
      support to work as well (test this out using Firefox with JavaScript disabled).

*** TODO Improved transcript display script
    See also: NOTE/2010-09-01-original+corrected-display/index.html

    HTML tags intended for showing edits in texts. Should be used to show the
    corrections.

    Script used to display transcripts prettily should have a function to
    enable/disable the displaying of original/corrected versions of the text.

        http://klingonska.cibo/canon/search/?file=1996-08-rt.txt&query=hello

    Each transcript in the http://klingonska.org/canon/ list should have a link
    to the prettified version (as well as to the original text formatted
    transcript).

***** TODO add proof of having TKD/TKW/KGT
      There should be a separate set-cookie script. Cookie should be encoded

      dict/lexicon.cgi should have a link to the cookie-setter script. And if
      the auth-cookie is set TKD/TKW/KGT transcript links should be unlocked.

      (This would have to be done in such a fashion that just accessing the link
      to e.g. the TKD transcript does not return the actual transcript, unless
      the user has the security cookie set properly.)

***** TODO source references should be links to canon/
***** TODO links to "Archive of Okrandian Canon" transcripts should look better
      Instead of filenames, there should be the title of the transcript (and
      possibly other information, such source date, author etc.).

      This should probably be solved by having an index of transcript metadata
      in a Perl on-disk database (indexed on filename) in the canon/ directory.
      This would have to be automatically rebuilt on the server when doing "git
      push", and on the client side on "git commit".

**** TODO Add irregular plurals in dictionary (already done?)
**** TODO Field for synonyms?
     E.g. to make words easier to look up. E.g. {'IqnaH} has a 'com' field
     specifying 'booger', which is a useful synonym for the purpose of
     searching.

     Some synonyms of this kind are already in dictionary. Search for "synonym"
     in the 'com' field to find them.
**** TODO Better listing of sources
     Specificly, since the 'en' and 'sv' fields are created from different
     sources, it would be desireble to list exactly which part of this fields
     that come from what source. -- Maybe one should rework the syntax of these
     fields?

     Perhaps something like this?

         tlh: {'ay'}
         en: "section" [TKD]; "part", "piece", "component" [KGT]

     or

         tlh: {'ay'}

**** TODO Standardize tlhingan-hol mailing refereces
     As of now refereces to the tlhingan-hol mailing list vary in form. They
     should always look the same. Model them after the "News" references?

       /Okay, here it comes. Besides of the students at the qepHom in
       SaarbrÃ¼cken, you are the first to read this. Note for the newbies: This
       is canon, i.e. official, directly from Marc Okrand, the creator of the
       Klingon Language:/

       Finally, someone last year asked for the word for "picture." At first,
       Maltz wondered why {nagh beQ} wasn't good enough. But then he thought
       about it some more and said that another word, {mIllogh}, could be used
       for any sort of depiction, including drawings, photographs, cartoons,
       icons on 21st-century computers, and so on.

       /Here's another word revealed at the qepHom in SaarbrÃ¼cken. Note for the
       newbies: This is canon, i.e. official, directly from Marc Okrand, the
       creator of the Klingon Language:/

       Maltz first said that Klingons don't have pillows and he wondered why
       anyone would want one. But he's seen them (somewhere) and knows what
       they are. So when pushed -- "If you have to call it something, what
       would you call it?" -- he said {ngogh tun}. A {ngogh} is a "block" or
       "lump" or "brick." He said he's seen humans eating {yuch ngoghmey} and
       found that strange. I'm not sure what form he'd prefer his {yuch} to be.

       He thought more about it and said maybe another way to say "pillow" was
       {QongDaq buq} "bed pouch," but he said that could also apply to a
       sleeping bag. Perhaps a sleeping bag is {QongDaq buq'a'} and a pillow is
       {QongDaq buqHom}. The word {buq} could be "bag, sack, pouch" or even
       "pocket." When clarity is needed, one could say, for example, {yopwaH
       buq} "pants pouch" or {wep buq} "coat pouch" for "pants pocket" or "coat
       pocket," but when the context is clear, {buq} alone would suffice for
       "pocket."

    Should make use of server side git hook 'post-receive' updating web page.

    The following works for just populating a git work tree from a repo:

        #!/bin/sh
        #
        # update website
        # "git-diff" cwd can be anything
        # $GIT_WORK_TREE must always be specified if using bare repo
        # $GIT_DIR is assumed to be cwd if not specified
        env -i git --work-tree=../experiment checkout -f

        # test that website does not diff from repository
        # "git-diff" cwd may be $GIT_DIR or $GIT_WORK_TREE
        # if $GIT_WORK_TREE, then $GIT_DIR must be specified
        # if $GIT_DIR, then both $GIT_DIR and $GIT_WORK_TREE must be specified
        XXX=`git --git-dir=. --work-tree=../experiment diff HEAD`
        if [ -z "$XXX" ]; then
            echo "WEBSITE UPDATED"
        else
            echo "WEBSITE UPDATE FAILED: The following files differ from repository"

   "http://klingonska.org/" should never be referred to as

** TODO Configure "MultiView" so users don't have to type file suffix  :CONF:
   Apache's "MultiView" seems like a cool config option. It makes it so that
   visitors can leave off the file suffix. (E.g. http://klingonska.org/links/
   would load "links.html" if there isn't also a "/links/index.html".)
