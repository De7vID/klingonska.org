  HTML tags intended for showing edits in texts. Should be used to show the

* TODO Apache config
** Use "MultiView" so users don't have to type the file suffix
   Apache's "MultiView" seems like a cool config option. It makes it so that
   visitors can leave off the file suffix. (E.g. http://klingonska.org/links/
   would load "links.html" if there isn't also a "/links/index.html".)

   "make hooks" should create the client-side relevant hooks.
** TODO Improve and optimize pre-commit hook
   Commits are veeeeryy slow because of (I assume) the fact that find is run on
   all files in the repository.

   Instead of searching all files for changed metadata, the pre-commit hook
   should only fetch metadata for files changed in the commit.

   Lists all files included in a commit:

       git ls-files --stage

     http://klingonska.org/canon/1993-10-01-pk.txt

     Make an invisible redirect to a CGI that deals with "authentication" -- if
     user is "authenticated" -- serves the transcript data. This script sets a
     cookie which is retained throughout the site (so only the first transcript
     request requires auth).

     The form should state explicitly that it uses cookies.

***** TODO Apache config(?)
****** TODO Make script work under redirect on HCoop
       Script "canon/show.cgi" works, if accessed directly, e.g.:
           http://klingonska.org/canon/show.cgi?file=1992-01-01-tkd.txt

       But not when using the redirected URL:

           RewriteRule /canon/([^/]*-(tkd|tkw|kgt|ck|pk).txt)$ canon/show.cgi?file=$1 [last]

       This will case redirects so that:
           http://klingonska.org/canon/1992-01-01-tkd.txt

       Is rewritten to:
           http://klingonska.org/canon/show.cgi?file=1992-01-01-tkd.txt

       Name: canon/show.cgi

       This script works the same as the old download.cgi, but also stores a
       cookie. If user already has valid cookie, no login procedure is
       required.
**** TODO Search engine improvements (canon/search/index.cgi)
***** TODO Add Chrome integration (some sort of open protocol?)
      Most sites search functions (e.g. YouTube, Wikipedia etc.) are

      name in the navigation bar, and then automatically do a search on that
      site without first having to visit it.

      I want that for klingonska!

      How is this done? Is it some kind of microformat that makes Chrome detect
      search engines?

***** TODO source file display should allow choice between original/corrected version
      When displaying files, should implement button to change between
      "original", "corrected" and "difference" views of the same text.

      JavaScript version for this is there:

      NOTE: <noscript> alternative is implemented in above HTML, but needs CGI

**** TODO add proof of having TKD/TKW/KGT
     There should be a separate set-cookie script. Cookie should be encoded

     dict/lexicon.cgi should have a link to the cookie-setter script. And if
     the auth-cookie is set TKD/TKW/KGT transcript links should be unlocked.

     (This would have to be done in such a fashion that just accessing the link
     to e.g. the TKD transcript does not return the actual transcript, unless
     the user has the security cookie set properly.)

**** TODO source references should be links to canon/
**** TODO links to "Archive of Okrandian Canon" transcripts should look better
     Instead of filenames, there should be the title of the transcript (and

     This should probably be solved by having an index of transcript metadata
     in a Perl on-disk database (indexed on filename) in the canon/ directory.
     This would have to be automatically rebuilt on the server when doing "git
     push", and on the client side on "git commit".

      B.J. Felix Malmenbeck
      De' Daj vItu'pu'!

      Visar sig att man kan använda ordet «rav» ("golv") som "minimum", ungefär
      som man använder «'aqroS» ("undersidan av överdelen") för "maximum". Det
      används på BoP-affischen i meningen «Hung buv rav: patlh Hut», som
      översätts som "Classified Level 9 and Above" men bokstavligen betyder
      "säkerhetsklassifikationsgolv: nivå 9". Kan vara värt att lägga till i
      {tlhIngan Hol mu'ghomlIj mach}.

       /Okay, here it comes. Besides of the students at the qepHom in
       Saarbrücken, you are the first to read this. Note for the newbies: This
       is canon, i.e. official, directly from Marc Okrand, the creator of the
       Klingon Language:/

       Finally, someone last year asked for the word for "picture." At first,
       Maltz wondered why {nagh beQ} wasn't good enough. But then he thought
       about it some more and said that another word, {mIllogh}, could be used
       for any sort of depiction, including drawings, photographs, cartoons,
       icons on 21st-century computers, and so on.

       /Here's another word revealed at the qepHom in Saarbrücken. Note for the
       newbies: This is canon, i.e. official, directly from Marc Okrand, the
       creator of the Klingon Language:/

       Maltz first said that Klingons don't have pillows and he wondered why
       anyone would want one. But he's seen them (somewhere) and knows what
       they are. So when pushed -- "If you have to call it something, what
       would you call it?" -- he said {ngogh tun}. A {ngogh} is a "block" or
       "lump" or "brick." He said he's seen humans eating {yuch ngoghmey} and
       found that strange. I'm not sure what form he'd prefer his {yuch} to be.

       He thought more about it and said maybe another way to say "pillow" was
       {QongDaq buq} "bed pouch," but he said that could also apply to a
       sleeping bag. Perhaps a sleeping bag is {QongDaq buq'a'} and a pillow is
       {QongDaq buqHom}. The word {buq} could be "bag, sack, pouch" or even
       "pocket." When clarity is needed, one could say, for example, {yopwaH
       buq} "pants pouch" or {wep buq} "coat pouch" for "pants pocket" or "coat
       pocket," but when the context is clear, {buq} alone would suffice for
       "pocket."

       There was a question about whether {tlhaptIH} was a good way to say
       "tractor beam." Maltz said he'd never heard that before, but he has
       heard {luHwI' tIH}.
