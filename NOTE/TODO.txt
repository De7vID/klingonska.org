Priorities:
1) IMPORTANT -- page visibly broken in bad way (bad link or somesuch) or
   new, very important information (like a new word in dictionary)
2) ugly -- page has minor flaw which looks unprofessional (but works)
3) EASY -- change or addition, material exists but is not shown/wasted
4) WANTED -- could be better, but is okay
5) MAYBE -- would be nice to have, but needs to be though about


On CSS ideas:
http://www.onextrapixel.com/2012/05/03/css-tricks-how-to-speed-up-css-rendering/

I tend to go with Paul Irish on this one...

"Aside from that, you are not allowed to care about the performance of * unless
you concatenate all your javascript, have it at the bottom, minify your css and
js, gzip all your assets, and losslessly compress all your images. If aren't
getting 90+ Page Speed scores, its way too early to be thinking about selector
optimization."

   Apache .htaccess file I had forgot to take into consideration in the new
   HCoop setup. I copied the relevant rewriteRules from the Apache file to
   HCoop's domtool, and web redirects seem to be up and working again.

* Site design annoyances+fixes
** TODO Cleanup breadcrumbs
   Some breadcrums use '&#8250;' other use '&gt;' should prolly just '&gt;' (it
   doesn't look all that much worse, and is guaranteed to work with a larger
   range of browsers).
** TODO Default tables should be borderless
   It is hard to unstyle a table, so the default table should behave very much
   like the default HTML table, i.e. it should be borderless, have collapsing
   borders, and probably no paddings and margins.

   My fave table with 2px black border should have 'class=border' or somesuch.
** TODO First-line indented paragraphs
   Many pages have the first line of each paragraph indented, rather a blank
   line between each paragraph. This should be achieved with a some class name
   (on a <div> or the main content div of that page). Inside such <div>s, <hr>
   should not be displayed, but only cause a blank line + non-indenting of
   first line of the next paragraph.

   This makes for pretty Markdown, since it can be written in the usual way,
   using '* * *' on a line by itself to make larger breaks in the text.

   Markdown should detect this mode by some metadata field.
** TODO Change link colors + remove underline
   Underlining really diminishes readability sometimes, for example when used
   with IPA (as on http://klingonska.lal/piqad/), or when used in tables where
   much data consist of links.

   It's important that links stand out, however, so maybe more traditional link
   colors should be used. Maybe just the traditional? (unvisited: #00e,
   visited: #551a8b, and hover/active: #06e). Or a slightly darker version
   thereof:

       a         { color: #11a; text-decoration: none; }
       a:visited { color: #516; }
       a:hover   { opacity: .65; }
* Site content
** TODO Do a surf-through check for weird/old shit
** TODO Systematic/site-wide changes
   I.e. changes that need to be applied to the web page as a whole.
*** TODO Site redesign
**** DONE Design new look (more modern looking, but still simple)
     CLOSED: [2012-06-09 Sat 11:21]
     This should fix:

       * Limiting line 'max-width' for readability
       * Niftier design with a splash of red color in the header
       * Using updated web standards (HTML5, Javascript, microdata etc.)
       * Use HTML5 Boilerplate
       * Building (minified) CSSes from SCSS (Sassy Stylesheets)
       * Using a HTML template = centralized header/footer
       * Page source (whenever possible) in markdown
**** DONE [100%] Move site repo to GitHub
     CLOSED: [2012-06-20 Wed 15:31]
     This will save about 50M of diskspace on HCoop (where space is expensive),
     and future minifications and file compressions will work to save even more
     space. (As long as the git repo resided on HCoop all changes would make
     the site take up more diskspace, since the repo always grows with each
     commit).
***** DONE Update the old repo on GitHub
      CLOSED: [2012-06-19 Tue 21:00]
      Change git repo remote 'origin' so it points to GitHub instead of HCoop.
      All future 'git push' will thus feed into GitHub.
***** DONE Remove HCoop git repo
      CLOSED: [2012-06-19 Tue 21:21]
      And un-publish it from HCoops list of git repos.
***** DONE Redirect git.klingonska.org to GitHub

***** DONE Publish modified site on HCoop

       CLOSED: [2012-06-26 Tue 09:01]
       The 'updated' date of the HTML page will *only* be taken from this
       header from now on. Should add some script that strongly encourages
       user to update this field when changes are made to the content.
***** DONE Rename propaganda/flygblad{1..3}.html -> flygblad{1..3}.html
      CLOSED: [2012-06-29 Fri 11:41]
***** DONE Make HCoop redirects from old to new flygblad{1..3}.html names

***** DONE Remove `akademien/stadgar.html` + `akademien/verksamhet.html`
      CLOSED: [2012-06-29 Fri 10:43]
      There are no links to these documents. It is no longer relevant in any way.
***** DONE Remove `klo/old` documents and subdirs
      CLOSED: [2012-06-29 Fri 11:13]
      They're not really interesting/relevant, since all the interesting parts
      are incorporated into the KLO pages. Old stuff is just an annoyance to
      maintain. (And, even after removal, would still be available in the git
      repo, if anyone *really* cared.)
***** [51%] Convert all pages to new HTML template
      Thereby centralizing the page header/footer etc. `bin/markdown2html` is
      the tool used for this, except for files in /dict/, which uses `parse`.
      Unifying these two tools into one will become a later issue, though.

      The following files need updating:

***** TODO Breadcrumbs should handle {...} notation in title
      Example of this not looking so good:

          Home > Om Klingonska Akademien > {tlhIngan Hol DajatlhlaH'a' SoH?}

      found on pages:
      http://klingonska.lal/akademien/flygblad1.html
      http://klingonska.lal/akademien/qephom.html
***** TODO Breadcrumbs should support 'up' metadata field
      The next-to-last breadcrumb link should be the page pointed to by the
      'up' metadata field (if it exists). This will (at least mostly) solve the
      the paginated page breadcrumb problem as well, by defining 'up' for all
      paginated pages.

      Breadcrumbs for multiple page article
      Example: http://klingonska.org/akademien/foton/2.html

      Home › Om Klingonska Akademien › Pictures from {qep’a’ SochDIch} (page 1)
      › Pictures from {qep’a’ SochDIch} (page 2)

      Page 2 should not include page 1 in the breadcrumbs and logo link should
      link to above directory for all pages.

      Same goes for http://klingonska.org/dict/, where the logo should link to
      http://klingonska.org/ on all pages, since there are links to all other
      pages on each page.

      Page that uses it: http://klingonska.lal/akademien/qephom.html
***** TODO Re-enable insertion of <time>...</time> in markdown2html (?)
      <time> should *not* be inserted inside previously existing <time> tags,
      nor in HTML attributes.

      <time> tag insertion was disabled since links to text documents in "The
      Archive of Okrandian Canon" (e.g. the final link to an article {HolQeD}
      8:1 on `/ref/color.html`) were messed up, by having <time> tags inserted
      into the href of the link.
***** TODO Pages to update design of separately
      These pages still use and include:
      `pagestats.css`

     * "Klingon language reference tools since 1998."?
**** [0%] Minor tweaks (low priority)
***** TODO Remove metadata field 'year', use 'created' and 'updated' instead
      'markdown2html' should base copyright year on creation date + last
      updated date so that, when updating a page, one only have to change one
      field.
***** TODO Add transcript of article in {HolQeD} 7:3, p.3 (?)

***** TODO Merge `uttal.html` inte `klo/grammatik-01.html`
      The article "En svensk guide till det klingonska uttalet" should be
      completely merged into the more extensive "Klingonsk ordbok". "Sounds of
      Klingon" also probably better translated "Klingonskt uttal". :)
***** TODO Fix Markdown processing inside HTML elements + speedup
      Since we want the content of block level elements to be processed for
      Markdown (and Markdown doesn't do that), the content of all HTML block
      level elements should be extracted and individually processed.

      This would most likely speed up processing of Markdown source files with
      much HTML in them (like `tkw.txt`).
***** TODO Fix wonky <title>
      Title for e.g. http://klingonska.org/tkw.html contains repeated elements.
      <title>The Klingon Way in pIqaD &ndash; *The Klingon Way* in {pIqaD} &ndash; Klingonska Akademien</title>
***** TODO Page margins should shrink in narrow window
      The line with should be constant for as long as possible, with the
      margins shrinking to give room for text if window is too narrow.
***** TODO Add info on "deciphered" text on skybox

      https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/the+downturned+version+as+comma./fd30b1121c986f7
***** TODO Automatic building of Table-of-Contents for longer articles
      `punct.html` could benefit from this (currently has quite an ugly <ul>
      with 'class="toc"' and some inline styles.

      Right now <!--TOC--> exists, but only works for KLO. It should be a
      standardized plugin kinda thing, which extracts info from markdown (or
      HTML) headlines.
***** TODO How to treat images wider than line width?
      `piqadpic.html` has some examples of this. Should images be resized to
      fit? It would be nice if they could come closer to the page margin than
      the ordinary text (when need be).
***** TODO Check & set 'title' and 'alt' tags according to standard
      What should they contain? Add appropriate stuff for screen readers and
      text browser.
***** TODO SVG for page design elements
****** TODO With PNG fallbacks where SVG is unsupported
****** TODO Use SVG for navigation menu bullets
****** TODO Convert nation flags (UK/SV) to SVG
***** TODO [#4] Are files in icons/ still used?
***** TODO [#4] Make logo wordwrap script work cross-browser
      It work decently already. Might be minor glitches on Opera or MSIE, just
      before word wrap applies. Low priority unless someone reports it faulty.

      Should make sure that the logo + title width, and the window width, actually
      reflects the real width on screen.

      Quirksmode has a nice article that might be illuminating on this subject.
      http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/getstyles.html
***** TODO Javascript to alert user of updated parts
      The navigation menus should have signage indicating that a section is
      newly updated if changed within the last -- month? two weeks?
*** TODO Linked images should have border highlight
    Maby have a 2px transparent border on all linked images, and then changing
    color on hover? Problem now is that if an image is linked or not isn't very
    obvious. Esp. look at:

        http://klingonska.elektra/songs/tahjaj_wo/
        http://klingonska.elektra/akademien/logo/

    Both are using the "gallery" stylesheet, and are thus findable with:

        grep gallery **/*.html
*** TODO All <time> tags should include time zone
    Can "yyyy-mm-dd+zz:zz" be used? Or does the "+zz:zz" *require* that a time
    is used too (i.e. "yyyy-mm-ddThh:hh:ss+zz:zz")?

    Time zone data should be +01:00 or +02:00 depending on whether the time
    described was during daylight savings time or not.
*** TODO Linking Klingon phrases to English translation?
    Is there a microdata for this? Should one surround the phrases using <span>
    like this: <span><b lang="tlh">ya'Da ya'Da</b> <i class="transl">yadda
    yadda</i></span> ? Or maybe use some identifier, which is the same between
    the two phrases, but otherwise unique in the document, as an attribute
    value?

    Regardless: Can this be autogenerated from Markdown? (Without building
    *too* much intelligence into the Markdown->HTML processor...)

*** DONE Mark all Klingon with <b lang="tlh">...</b>
    CLOSED: [2011-07-04 Mon 09:37]
*** TODO Disable word-wrap for naked Klingon affixes
    Use 'class="affix"', e.g. <b lang="tlh" class="affix">...</b>.

    Naked suffixes (e.g. {-moH}) (in e.g. dict/suffix.html) are sometimes
    wordwrapped, causing the hyphen to occur on a line of its own, and the
    suffix to come first on the following line. Like this:

        text text -
        moH text text

    That looks ugly. Such suffixes should have a class of "affix" and a
    stylesheet preventing wordwrap (i.e. "white-space: nowrap;").

    NOTE: Previously used Unicode character for non-breaking hyphen, but this
    is bad -- since that means one cannot search for them on a page using the
    ^F browser function.
*** TODO Replace <em>...</em> for translation with <i class="transl">...</i>
*** TODO Mark translated phrases with <i class="transl">...</i>
    What should be the markup? 'class="transl"'? No "lang" attribute
    generally be necessary, since it would (usually) be the same language as
    the surrounding text.
*** TODO Title page
**** [#5] Time limited displaying of new pages?
     Add some thing (javascript?) to indicate pages that have been recently
     updated This should maybe be displayed as "New!" for a week, and "New"
     (with less exclamation marks) for a month, or somesuch.

     This is remnant markup from an earlier such thought:

     <tr><td align=right valign=center><img src="/pic/ny.gif" width=31 height=14 alt="Ny" hspace=5></td>
     <tr><td align=right valign=center><img src="/pic/andrad.gif" width=54 height=14 alt="Ändrad" hspace=5></td>

*** TODO RSS/Atom feed for updates

    dict/lexicon.cgi. Maybe make a list of file relations?

*** TODO [#4] Add "site news"/updated page

***** TODO Allow KA-logo to overlap the tabs
      Either the tabs (only) should be clickable, or only the non-transparent

***** TODO Use only simplest word from the dictionary in analysis
      E.g. {bochmoHwI'} is both in dictionary and can be derived from rules.
      Probably requires field in dictionary with breakdown of gramatically
      complex words. E.g. the entry on {bochmoHwI'} should have a field
      specifying "boch(v)-moH(vs4)-wI'(vs9n)".

      The result of this should also be presented in the '# different' counter,

*** TODO New header fields for transcripts
**** TODO Reason for canonicity
     Should be explaining the source's tie to Marc Okrand. E.g. "Translation by
     Marc Okrand", "Book's glossary vetted by Marc Okrand", "Written by Marc
     Okrand" etc.
**** TODO URL of transcript in question
     The address of the original page, so that people can find their way back
     if it circulates.
**** TODO "Video" -- URL of video on klingonska.org
     Maybe this should be more general? "Attachment"(?) -- Could then be used
     to point out HTML, video and all other versions of the document.
**** TODO A "see also" field
     URL + description of sources outside of klingonska.org.
**** TODO A field for abbreviated name of source
     Examples: TKD, Hallmark, 'u'-MTK, BoP (KBoP), KGT, HQ12:1, etc
*** TODO Add link to YouTube version of Star Trek Klingon

**** DONE Allow only "authorized" access to TKD/TKW/KGT/CK/PK transcripts
     CLOSED: [2011-04-10 Sun 02:36]
     The following pages should not be accessible directly:

     http://klingonska.org/canon/1992-01-01-tkd.txt
     http://klingonska.org/canon/1996-05-01-tkw.txt

     http://klingonska.org/canon/1992-10-01-ck.txt
     http://klingonska.org/canon/1993-10-01-pk.txt

     Make an invisible redirect to a CGI that deals with "authentication" -- if
     user is "authenticated" -- serves the transcript data. This script sets a
     cookie which is retained throughout the site (so only the first transcript
     request requires auth).

     The form should state explicitly that it uses cookies.

****** DONE Make script work under redirect on HCoop
       CLOSED: [2011-04-10 Sun 02:35]
       The following rewrite rule in ~/.domtool/klingonska.org did the trick:

           (* transcripts requiring authentication for access *)
           rewriteRule "^/canon/([^/]*-(tkd|tkw|kgt|ck|pk)\.txt)$" "/canon/show.cgi?file=$1" [last];
****** DONE Block/rewrite accesses to TKD/KGT/TKW transcripts
       CLOSED: [2010-03-24 Thu 10:28]
       The following Apache config seem to work excellently:

           RewriteEngine On
           RewriteRule /canon/([^/]*-(tkd|tkw|kgt|ck|pk).txt)$ canon/show.cgi?file=$1 [last]

       This will case redirects so that:
           http://klingonska.org/canon/1992-01-01-tkd.txt

       Is rewritten to:
           http://klingonska.org/canon/show.cgi?file=1992-01-01-tkd.txt

****** DONE Write script for showing transcripts
       CLOSED: [2011-04-09 Sat 21:57]
       Name: canon/show.cgi

       This script works the same as the old download.cgi, but also stores a
       cookie. If user already has valid cookie, no login procedure is
       required.
**** TODO Search engine improvements (canon/search/index.cgi)
***** TODO [#2] Review/improve match listings
      This should, preferably, be as similar as possible to the list of sources
      in the main article. Try to imitate Google search results in appearance?
***** TODO Add Chrome integration (some sort of open protocol?)
      Most sites search functions (e.g. YouTube, Wikipedia etc.) are
      automatically detected by Chrome, so that you can auto-complete the site
      name in the navigation bar, and then automatically do a search on that
      site without first having to visit it.

      I want that for klingonska!

      How is this done? Is it some kind of microformat that makes Chrome detect
      search engines?

***** TODO Query prefix "file:" to search only a specific file
      This should allow globs and comma-separated file names, e.g.
      "file:*holqed*", "file:*email,*news" etc.
***** TODO List of files should be available
***** TODO Source file display should allow choice between original/corrected version
      When displaying files, should implement button to change between
      "original", "corrected" and "difference" views of the same text.

      JavaScript version for this is there:
      NOTE/2010-09-01-original+corrected-display/index.html

      NOTE: <noscript> alternative is implemented in above HTML, but needs CGI
      support to work as well (test this out using Firefox with JavaScript disabled).

*** TODO Improved transcript display script
    See also: NOTE/2010-09-01-original+corrected-display/index.html

    HTML tags intended for showing edits in texts. Should be used to show the
    corrections.

    Script used to display transcripts prettily should have a function to
    enable/disable the displaying of original/corrected versions of the text.

        http://klingonska.cibo/canon/search/?file=1996-08-rt.txt&query=hello

    Each transcript in the http://klingonska.org/canon/ list should have a link
    to the prettified version (as well as to the original text formatted
    transcript).

**** DONE Add Philip Newton's {toqvIr} correction & reply to him
     CLOSED: [2012-03-25 Sun 20:32]
     (Reported via email on Monday March 12, 2012.)

     {toqvIr} is called a "Tokvirian skink" in the body of KGT (p. 88) but a
     "Tokvarian skink" (-a- rather than -i-) in the dictionary part.

     You have a note to this effect ("Tokvarian skink [[Tokvarian:=Tokvirian]]") in
     the K-E portion of canon/1997-11-01-kgt.txt) but you have "Tokvirian
     skink" with -i- in the E-K portion, even though my KGT has "Tokvarian"
     there, too. ("My KGT" = First Pocket Books trade paperback printing
     September 1997, ISBN 0-671-00995-8, in case editions vary.)

     So the E-K should be updated to similar wording as in the K-E side
     ("Tokvarian", with a correction note at the end of the line).

     in all scripts working against the dictionary. (CGI + dictionary checker?)
**** TODO Add 'def: ST5' for all words in 1999-12-holqed-08-4-b.txt(?)
     I'm not sure the HQ8:4 ("Notes from Star Trek V: The Final Frontier")
     article actually reflects Klingon dialogue, as it appears in the movie.

     But all words source referenced with that {HolQeD} article, and that is
     also in the final move should have 'ref: ST5' or 'def: ST5'.
**** TODO Make sure all Eurotalk words has proper 'data' fields

***** TODO Use filenames as source references(?)
      Or maybe one should go the other way? Have a check-dict that knows all
      sources, and their filenames and complain unless it exists... (?) --
      Problem with such an approach would be that the lexicon CGI script would
      have to include this info as well in order to present links to the
      Archive of Okrandian Canon.
***** TODO <...> should mean translation/italic everywhere
      And be used in 'see:' and 'com:' and 'desc:'..

      This would require a different markup symbol for the lookup words in

***** TODO Better listing of sources is 'en:' and 'sv:' fields
      Specificly, since the 'en' and 'sv' fields are created from different
      sources, it would be desireble to list exactly which part of this fields
      that come from what source. -- Maybe one should rework the syntax of these
      fields?

      Perhaps something like this?

          tlh: {'ay'}
          en: "section" [TKD]; "part", "piece", "component" [KGT]

      or

          tlh: {'ay'}
          en: <section> [TKD]; <part>, <piece>, <component> [KGT]; «chapter»

      Where "chapter" would then be a synonym (without support in canon).

      Or maybe the following would be better?

          tlh: {HuH}
          en: bile, slime, gall
          ref: bile; gall; slime
          sv:  galla; slem

      Visar sig att man kan använda ordet «rav» ("golv") som "minimum", ungefär
      som man använder «'aqroS» ("undersidan av överdelen") för "maximum". Det
      används på BoP-affischen i meningen «Hung buv rav: patlh Hut», som
      översätts som "Classified Level 9 and Above" men bokstavligen betyder
      "säkerhetsklassifikationsgolv: nivå 9". Kan vara värt att lägga till i

       /Okay, here it comes. Besides of the students at the qepHom in
       Saarbrücken, you are the first to read this. Note for the newbies: This
       is canon, i.e. official, directly from Marc Okrand, the creator of the
       Klingon Language:/

       Finally, someone last year asked for the word for "picture." At first,
       Maltz wondered why {nagh beQ} wasn't good enough. But then he thought
       about it some more and said that another word, {mIllogh}, could be used
       for any sort of depiction, including drawings, photographs, cartoons,
       icons on 21st-century computers, and so on.

       /Here's another word revealed at the qepHom in Saarbrücken. Note for the
       newbies: This is canon, i.e. official, directly from Marc Okrand, the
       creator of the Klingon Language:/

       Maltz first said that Klingons don't have pillows and he wondered why
       anyone would want one. But he's seen them (somewhere) and knows what
       they are. So when pushed -- "If you have to call it something, what
       would you call it?" -- he said {ngogh tun}. A {ngogh} is a "block" or
       "lump" or "brick." He said he's seen humans eating {yuch ngoghmey} and
       found that strange. I'm not sure what form he'd prefer his {yuch} to be.

       He thought more about it and said maybe another way to say "pillow" was
       {QongDaq buq} "bed pouch," but he said that could also apply to a
       sleeping bag. Perhaps a sleeping bag is {QongDaq buq'a'} and a pillow is
       {QongDaq buqHom}. The word {buq} could be "bag, sack, pouch" or even
       "pocket." When clarity is needed, one could say, for example, {yopwaH
       buq} "pants pouch" or {wep buq} "coat pouch" for "pants pocket" or "coat
       pocket," but when the context is clear, {buq} alone would suffice for
       "pocket."

     It should be included in the dictionary, with 'data: non-canon', so others
     won't include it in their dictionaries.

*** Klingon Pocket Dictionary (paper version)
**** English--Klingon part
***** TODO Change layout in English--Klingon part
      It should look something like this:

      (Typographic key: *sans serif* /italic/ {bold})

          *worthless*  /v/  {lo'laHbe'} be ~
          *worthless*  /v/  be ~ {lo'laHbe'}

          *friend* /n/ close male ~ of a male
            {maqoch} buddy, pal [KGT]
          *buddy* /n/ {maqoch} pal, close male
            friend of a male
          *close male friend of a male* /n/
            {maqoch} buddy, pal

          *fresh* /v/ be ~ {baQ} be just picked
            (fruit, vegetable)
          *ceiling* /n/ {pa' beb} (of a room on
            the top story of a structure)
          *pa' beb* /n/ ceiling (of a room on the
            top story of a structure) [News
            1998-12-07; HQ8:3 p.2]

       Currently, if you look up a word like "wrong", you'll find:

           *wrong* /v/ {muj} be ~

       Which makes it very easy to miss that fact the word is adjectival in
       nature. I propose that this should instead be represented as:

           *wrong* /v/ be ~ {muj}

       Let's take a look at the word defined as "<buddy>, <pal>, <close male
       <friend>> of a male (n)" in the database below. Currently you can find
       the entries:

           *buddy* /n/ {maqoch} pal, close male
             friend of a male
           *close male friend* /n/ {maqoch} buddy,
             pal, ~ of a male
           *friend* /n/ {maqoch} buddy, pal, close
             male ~ of a male
           *pal* /n/ {maqoch} buddy, close male
             friend of a male

       But I think this should instead be represented as:

           *buddy* /n/ {maqoch} pal, close male
             friend of a male
           *close male friend* /n/ ~ of a male
             {maqoch} buddy, pal
           *friend* /n/ close male ~ of a male
             {maqoch} buddy, pal
           *pal* /n/ {maqoch} buddy, close male
             friend of a male

       The idea is that the definition (but not the entire description, since
       we want to keep it short) from which the lookup entry was taken should
       be presented to the reader before the Klingon word, so that the reader
       have as much context as possible to relate the word to.

     They're currently all stripped in the Klingon--English side of the

     Should I remove toe words ending in {-wI'}? They're included is it looks
     now.

     Some of them (all?) are quite interpretable without specific entries in
     the Klingon--English side of the dictionary. E.g.

         {baHwI'} "one who shoots" ("gunner")
         {jajvam} "this day" ("today")
         {jagmoH} "cause to be bold" ("embolden")

     Derived forms that have English translations which differ a in (initial)
     spelling might be interesting to retain for ease of lookup.

     Some phrases might not be interpretable, without a non-literal
     translation?

* Web server config
** TODO All files should have just *one* canonical URL                 :CONF:
   "http://klingonska.org/" should never be referred to as
   "http://klingonska.org/index.html". Any references to the index.html version
   should be rewritten to the former.
** TODO Configure "MultiView" so users don't have to type file suffix  :CONF:
   Apache's "MultiView" seems like a cool config option. It makes it so that
   visitors can leave off the file suffix. (E.g. http://klingonska.org/links/
   would load "links.html" if there isn't also a "/links/index.html".)

     "En domänflytt kan ta mellan 5-18 dagar och när flytten är klar så kommer
     du att motta en årsfaktura. Ditt domännamn förnyas i samband med flytten."

     Om du vill lägga till domänen i ett befintligt konto gör du detta genom att
     logga in och sedan använda menyvalet "Domän och webb" -> "Lägg till
     domännamn".

     Kontrollera även att domännamnet är upplåst för överföring samt att den
     administrativa kontakten är aktuell.

     Överföringen av domännamnet beställer du sedan via ditt konto och menyvalet
     "Domän och webb" -> "Transfer av domännamn".
